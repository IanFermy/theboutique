                <i>Stacy walks out the door.  A cab is waiting for her.  She checks the window.</i><br><br>

                Stacy:  Chris.<Br><br>

                <i>The driver nods.  Stacy enters the backseat</i><br><br>

                ...<br><br>

                <i>A scraping can be heard.  Finally the coffin opens and Stacy jumps out.</i><br><br>

                Stacy:<i>crying</i><br>
                Erik: It's okay. It's okay.  I got you. It's okay.  The police are on the way.  I heard you screaming.  It's okay.<br><br>

                Stacy: No mom.  I'm a big girl.  I...need to start doing things on my own.  Tonight is my night.<br><br>

                <i>Stacy walks outside.  There is a cab waiting for her.  She hesitates then walks toward it.</i><br><br>

                Stacy: Jerry?<br>

                Jerry: Yes.<br>

                Erik: Stacy? <br><br>

                <i>Erik bursts into action.  He tackles the driver.  Kicks him in the head and knocks him out.  He reaches around in time to catch Stacy.</i><br><br>

                ...<br><br>

                <i>Stacy is in the police precinct</i><br><br>

                Detective: It's horrible luck.  Your attackers were brothers.  We've got them.  We're going to make sure this never happens to anyone else again.<br><br>

                <i>Stacy's house. She is in the bath.  Her phone rings.  She reaches for it as the doorbell rings.  She grabs a towel and hurries to the door.  She answers the phone while opening the door.</i><br><br>

                Detective: Stacy!  Stacy!  There's been a breakout.  The brothers have escaped.  Stacy!  Do you hear me?  The brothers have escaped.<br><br>

                <i>Chris and Jerry, the brothers, are standing outside the door, smiling.</i><br><br>

                Erik: <i>from the kitchen.</i> Who is it Stac?
