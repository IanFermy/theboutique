            <span>I thought about you before the explosion. I didn't want to think about you anymore. When I took this job, I knew I was done. But ever since I've been here I've smelled you everywhere. <br><br>
                What?<br><br>
                I'm going to nail you to the cross Detective.<br><br>
                Officer Stevens I order you to clarify yourself. <br><br>
                The containers were full of water. We didn’t survive. We were sheltered from the blast. That's what they were designed to do, that's what you designed it for. Except you ran into me…or I ran into you. <br><br>
                Oh no	<br><br>
                I…I only followed you…your scent. That's why I was there.
