    <h2>The Boy Rhymes</h2>

    <div>
        Take it back to the old days<br>
Popping pussy like all day<br>
She asked what's the foreplay<br><br>
Bitch I got paid<br>
So slay<br>
I'm just gay<br>
Pulling up Sway<br>
But the commentary Jay<br>
You go cray<br>
I will lay with a Rushmore face<br><br>

*fin*

    <div>
        I pulled up to the world in 92<br>
It was over for you<br>
I'm like smart for two<br>
Compact and minimal<br>
A millionaire on cue<br>
You can hate<br>
I'll congratulate cause<br>
Your girl was jumped up<br>
Yes she was on queue<br>
I'll send her back to you<br>
First I'll keep her after school<br>
Teach a few things<br>
Then she'll share that shit with you<br>
That's the trickle down from he<br>
Who<br>
Grinds over night<br>
Never snitches on a fight<br>
Swerving all the ditches<br>
If we flipping cause we flipped it<br>
Like all caps<br>
We fear that we're relentless<br><br>
*fin*

    <div>
        It isn't dark<br>
It's only dim light<br>
Catch me on a ark<br>
Moving down south<br>
Cause the weather isn't sparse<br>
I'm not a narc<br>
I just never learned to park<br>
It's never in the card<br>
My fates on large<br>
Lady luck's on pause<br>
Puc's on guard<br>
I say en guard<br>
I never regard<br>
A dis for the tard<br>
Never look far<br>
53 in the deck<br>
I never respect feeling blessed<br>
I'm never feeling lessed<br>
N-O to moe<br>
That's three in the chest<br>
My chest look flex<br>
I'm ducking complex<br>
That's daft in my duff<br>
Can't pass me the dutch<br>
I'm flashy as fuck<br>
I'd say I'm blessed<br>
But they all up on they knees<br>
A complex<br>
Another men-ta-la-ty<br>
It's all men<br>
That's no T T<br>
That's all I'm saying<br>
so fuck PT<br><br>
*fin*

    <div>
I ain't tryin die tonight<br>
But<br>
Everyday's another fight<br>
Slut<br>
Here I am<br>
Flying off <br>
like I'm Sput<br>
Cut<br>
On the bus <br>
Ain't shit stuck<br>
Tut<br>
She hit me up<br>
Driver is too fucked up<br>
Thud<br>
Backstroke fucked <br>
So I sidestroked up<br>
But the call never nut<br>
So it's on to the truck<br>
And my armpit is smut<br>
It's like emo to us<br>
So put your hook here<br>
The ear never fears<br>
It only bleeds all the mem-
o-ry<br>
Then I woke up in uh nother street<br><br>
*fin*

<div>
    Is my timing off?<br>
And my house is the definition <br>
Of workaholic anonymous <br>
Then you want to walk into the kitchen<br>
Without stepping over a wolf<br>
But that's not the way we living<br>

Did I lose you?<br>
Did I?<br>
Did Velma go Zoinks!<br>
Did she? Did she?<br>
All of the boys please record the message<br>
Cause the higher up have conspired<br>
And it's like being plugged<br>
But to a frayed wire<br>

But even jacked we jacked<br>
We never stress for a moment<br>
We hit the road whenever<br><br>

<div>
I donâ€™t have perfection like other people<br>
But I have one heart that will always be loyal to you<br>
I'll never be soil to you<br>
I'll try to spoil you<br>	
Pick you up and coil you<br>
Fuck up anybody that pulls up to foil you<br>
That's a destroyer for you<br>
In your back poc<br>
It'll never bounce for you<br>
I got an ounce of funny<br>
And I'll use it all on you<br>
It's pour boys<br>
Poor things<br>
50 cents<br>	
How you teach me how to stunt ma<br>
Your monster's on deck<br>
And you know that we up rihh<br><br>
*fin*

Ouuouuh babebabebaeebayy<br>
I saw you looking at me...<br>
You were walking down the street...<br>
I thought that maybe I should leave...<br>
But I had to wait and see...<br>

Girl...maybe you can be my king...<br>
I'll...let you run everything...<br>
I...doubt that I'll be your queen...I'm a playaa<br>
Maybe I'll hide...<br>
I can't talk...<br>
I might slip...<br>
I'll spit a brick...<br>
Let me fantasize this shit...<br>
You're probably from the east...<br>
Slick and petite...<br>
{-Hook}...Whoa itty bitty I gotta know your name,<br>
So can I pick your brain, know I got a little change
<br> 
and we can make this thing Go...{Hook-}<br>
Slow is your style...<br>
Let's look around...<br>
I'll look at you...<br>
I'll see what you do...<br>
I'll spot you boo...<br>	
This is so new...<br>
But I thought that you knew...<br>
Any other dude...<br>
Is a new afternoon...<br>
This is me and you...<br>
Heartshakes under moons...<br>
That's where I'll see you swoon...<br>
Please don't make me croon<br>
You alight so bright...<br>
Bet you'll turn me to a coon...<br>
Maybe just a loon...<br>
Shit...switch the tune<br>
{Hook}<br>
Straight to my room...<br>
I thought I'd make the boom...<br>
But she said .stop...<br>
Now I'm in a box...<br>
My dick is a brick,<br>
I...I thought I was a top...<br>
thinking I'm on top...<br>
She handed me a lock...<br><br>
