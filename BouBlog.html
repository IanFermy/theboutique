        So I want to say that I’ve reached year two of working on a start up.  This is a new years / two year update kind of blog.  It’s been a constant high, with regular lows.  Understand that I’m coming from a place where I went from a structured system of advancement (a career) to working for myself.  I hadn’t realized that I fall into the category of those who underwent a career shift until now.  The move was out of necessity.  I fear a crumbling social structure bought on a quick need for “something”. My retirement plan became something that kicked up in my mid twenties.  With this- understand that the plan was to acquire the skills needed so that in “retirement” I’ll … I don’t know…have the skills.  So here I am launching a company on the fly without the skills to run the company.  Need breeds opportunity (or something like that) and here I am two years later.    
            
        I’ve stayed persistent.  That is something I would congratulate myself on.  And the struggles are worth being congratulated.  There’s never enough money for a startup. But here we are.  I managed to acquire, lose, and acquire and gain.  And lose again. It’s partly the nature of my activities. There’s a high level of exposure and a greater cost of security then I anticipated, apart from in my nightmares.  But I’m lucky enough to make it to my third edition (if you can call it that) and as that was better than the first, the third will be very exciting.  
        
        Next is adapting.  The start of 2022 the concept of “features” came into play.  I switched interfaces to move in a direction more in line with the company and as I expected there are many more options.  There are many options.  Options many…catch my drift.  Picking a path and sticking with it was the most important part in the designing process.  Once again persistence is key.  A few weeks ago I developed a company statement.  It was a few lines, but I see them as the most important.  Fresh now, I know I will look towards those words for guidance in the future.  I say this because of my fears. 
        
        While there are many things I would congratulate myself on, there are things that straight terrify me.  Building a company may be the hardest thing in the world.  I’ve got white hair.  I’m checking to see if they’ll stick around. Design is tough.  Designing for the future is even tougher.  Not giving  a fuck a super easy. I question myself a lot.  Get stumped a lot.  Even procrastinate a lot.  Then back to the social stresses- imagine an epidemic that shuts everything down.  I mean when I work I play.  Imagine having nowhere to play.  I’m sure I made way less than if I were in a healthy environment and able to enjoy myself.  It’s been tough navigating through the fog.  The fog of young adulthood.  The fog of spiritual enlightenment.  
        
        Necessity breeds opportunity.  Work has been my coping mechanism for these stressors.  You would expect more stress, but there is a joy in being stumped.    There is an acceptance of “always stumped”.  Spring of 2019 the company was in; winter 2021 we're doing well.  It’s not an easy ascertainment. Any success I attribute to a “working company”.  I believe in the objective.  I believe in its sustainability, and that is the beacon of light.   I’ve moved into the prototyping arena.  I’m out of the conceptualizing phase.  2022 will be an exciting year.  This blog was special, I don’t plan a yearly review, and I don’t plan on doing one next year.  Maybe the year after or within 5.  I’m sure the system's gains and losses will be the same, but so will the profit.

            The Starving Artist<br>
            BouBlog	<br>
            05/18/2022<br><br>

    <div class="starvinArtistText">
This blog kind of goes with my last entry.   The last entry was a bit of an update.  Two years into building a start up, it seemed appropriate to do an update.  So, how does this blog connect to the previous?  The connection is eating.  EATING.  The impulse to build a company, rather this company (A Fermy Boutique) came from fear.  Specifically a fear of starving.  At the end of the day I can call myself a shop owner.  I can now, but I wasn't always able to.  I used to go by the title of artist and before then I called myself an actor.  

I really enjoyed being an actor.  I always like to tell the story of the dressing room.   I was cast in a production of Portrait of a Madonna by Tennessee Williams.  I sucked.   Completely.  I was a flower in elementary, and I played a brother (with only one scene) in middle school.  After middle school I wanted to be an actor.  I managed to get accepted into an arts program for high school, and cast in Portrait.  I wasn't ready, but the "acting bug" became a parasite in the dressing room.  It was like a locker room but co-ed.  I told myself I wanted more of this.  

This wasn't enough to be an actor.  A few naked bodies did not transfer into Meisner and Stanislavsky.  I had a breakdown in the 10th grade.  Remember I'm in an arts program.  If I couldn't get it together, I needed to be somewhere else.  Luckily two experiences kept me on track- an amazing performance from another student, and a little encouragement from a friend.  Without these two I wouldn't be here now. I buckled my belt and fully committed to becoming an actor.

The story continued into college.  I did four years of high school with no real plan of going to college.  I realized that I wasn't good enough.  The industry is the most EVERYTHING in the world.  I didn't feel prepared.  Going to college caused a shift I didn't expect.  I became an artist.

So far there are a few important words in this article.  Those words are wanted and be.  I wanted to be an actor(want).  Then one day that turned into I am an actor(be).  In college that turned into I am an artist.  That terrified me.  What goes with artist? Starving.  I did not want to starve.  

The Starving Artist.  It's as much a culture within the industry as it is a weapon outside the industry.  The industry pushes the idea of art that is produced through an artists bones.  

"If it hurts keep going" - shin splints during dance class. 
"Actors don't need water" - movement class

The industry prioritizes giving your all.  Frequently that's all you have. Of course I welcomed the challenges of industry in hopes of "a big break".

Outside the industry an artist gets even less. I can't comment too much on the outside. I'm industry- I can only comment from the perspective of my own experience with those outside the industry.   I don't consider myself famous, but a few tv commercials will make fuckers hostile.  Rejection, loneliness, fakeness, abuse are things that I get challenged with everyday.  

Here we have a starving artist.  The Starving Artist starves physically, mentally, and spiritually.  The ailments and causes are complicated and not what this blog is about.  This blog is about doing better.  Eat.  An actor acts…but an artist creates.  Creation is taking what is within and showing it off.  If it's pain- you show it off.   If it's joy- you show it off.  If it's lust- you get the point.  

The funny thing about within is that it comes from without.  As my artist organ became to develop I needed to figure out how to eat so that my creations can be true to me.  It's normal, I guess, to spit at someone if someone just spit at you, but I'm an artist.  Is that what I want to create? A Fermy Boutique is a tool for me to be in control of my creation.  Ian Fermy the Actor is a tool.  In my profession I don't say my own words, wear my own clothes, or even walk my own walk.  My job is to fill the container of a play.  Ian Fermy the artist is disgusted by that.  Ian Fermy the artist is terrified of starving.  There's a lot of power in the act, but during the act you give up a lot.  There's a reason actors in the past we're buried in separate plots.  

Through A Fermy Boutique I enjoy that I don't have to check my work or impress anyone other than myself.  I love leaving little channels of income that are my responsibility.  I love searching for my own fan base and giving them a place to enjoy me.  I also love the lack of responsibility and servitude that comes with being in a cast or working amongst others.  But an artist must fight with all their might to stay an artist.  To starve means that your body, mind and soul are under attack.  This will be visible to the fans.  It will corrupt your art, and the ones you will excite are the ones who put it there.  

The responsibility falls to the actorartist to create a balance between vulnerability and fortitude.

        A statement on 1200 Days of Semen Retention by Elija Maddden
        BouBlog	<br>
        05/22/2022<br><br>

    <div class="mtbText">
        Wow.  I'm not sure where to start.  I didn't plan to write this, and didn't think I would hit this subject.  I've got a list of topics and this is not on it.  I ran across this video on YouTube and was consumed by it. There are many points that I agree on.  Actually all the points can be summed up in "Protect your family by being a man".  However there are things that stand out to me.  Actually maybe I should preface this by not calling it an actual review.  Elijah Madden spoke on the advantage of semen retention.  He didn't speak on it's benefits.  The benefits would be more of a physical conversation, but he was more spiritual on the topic.  Though I'm sure he is fully aware of the benefits.
	
        The direction that I want to take my blog is in my experience with semen retention.  Yes, I am part of the community.  I have been for several years.  Maybe Madden would disagree, because my method is quite different.  I went the edging route rather than the no fap route.  After hearing him speak on the subject I believe though we are part of the same community of semen retention,  but we do it for different reasons.  I'll let you listen to Madden's talk so you can get his opinion.  The link is above.  If I mention him below it's really just in reference rather than an opinion piece or something.  Like I said this is about my experience with semen retention.  
        
        I believe in the fap.  As a boy I was conscious of the dick game.  I've always wanted mine to be on point.  I was fascinated by men who last long enough.  I wouldn't say it's about lasting hours like my blood is made of viagra, but long enough to share the experience with a female.  10 minutes…20.minutes.  I don't know…or care really. I am present, and I am diving in and out- reacting to everything she is giving.  I've even lasted 1 minute- unbothered.  The second time is always better though:).  
        
        It was 3rd and 4th year of college when I started experimenting with semen retention with edging as my guide.  I share a lot of the spiritual views that Madden commented on. I don't sleep with a lot of women because I know what it means to enter a woman.  You physically are connected. Your spiritual energy is beating those walls as well, only unlike a penis that spiritual energy penetrates much deeper.  That's the dick I actually use.  Now I don't sleep with a lot of women, but to contrast Madden I would sleep with anyone who would sleep with me.  (I don't want to explain myself because I plan to write a blog about it, but this part can be confusing.  I think there is something godly in sexual attraction.  That's all I'll say for now.) Sex, child birth, and child rearing are different things to me. 
        
        Now I'm not a perfect man.  I don't intend to be.  I'm as much of a hoe as I am a pimp. When one sleeps with a woman, yes, whatever she is you become.  But what about what I am putting into her.  I sadly don't…fully register a woman.  She is there, but we are one, so I am there.  Really it's just I. I masturbate so much that sex can feel like I'm fucking myself. 
        
        I think this goes hand in hand with a strong stoicism. I've gotten in trouble.  But nothing I wouldn't expect.  And of course I take precautions out the ass. I don't teach a course but if I did- use a condom, pull out, and put her on the pill.  If one fails, you've got two more.  I'm 29 with no kids and std's have come back negative, so I guarantee this.  
        
        But back to what I'm putting in her.  I don't think a woman should have to live a crazy righteous life for me to sleep with her. She probably fucked someone before she pulled up.  Yes, that dude is still in there.  But I don't mind. *No crossing swords.* I don't want to reject the point that Madden made. Women can be very conniving.  Despicabily so. But in life there is a constant give and take.  Like I said I stay present…through everything.  Maybe stoicism prevents me from believing in mistakes.  That's nothing that's happened that I didn't deserve.  
        
        Now it's 2022.  That's 6 or 7 years of edging.  I've reached the point where if I can "remember" lol or over power the urge not a drop will come out.  I've actually got to squeeze that bit out.  And it's only led to more discoveries.  
        
        In 2021 I edged regularly.  Maybe 3 times as much as I did in the past because I'd gotten better at it.  I came up with the plan to edge for one month straight then rest the next month and again.  Everything was going fine as long as I failed…lol. Maybe I'll bust a nut a couple times during the no nut months.  Eventually I became strong enough to go the whole month.  I haven't edged since.  Not really.  That's how hard that month was.  I had to question the health behind that method.  I did some research and maybe there was some mention of cancer.  Maybe I believe it because it was a very traumatic experience.  Blue balls maximus.  You don't know blue balls until you've given it to yourself. The results were there.  I had a male orgasm.  I think there's a difference between an orgasm and cumming.  I plan on blogging about it in the future so I don't plan to go into detail, but what a fucking treat.  But what fucking pain!   
        
        Like Madden the point of semen retention is to be a better man.  Whatever that means to you, some kind of semen retention needs to be part of your lifestyle.  Whether you can get a million women or none.  You really want to separate yourself from the female.  I'm not sure who I would be without it, but at any point in life I want to look back and say I'm better.  
        
        Now at the end I want to comment on the cultural differences between no fap and edging.  I think there could be a difference in how we rear children.  For Madden it's very head of the household.  He urges to wait until marriage. Hold out until the perfect woman. Probably with no fap.  I truly believe in that ideal.  Maybe I should say that "thought process" because in that ideal there is this image of a perfect woman.  I'm an immigrant.  I don't know who I have to be in America to get a "perfect woman" ,but I didn't know they existed.  With edging I was already committed to a single life. There's space for family but I'm high functioning.  Of course I can raise a high functioning family or a family that can orbit my functions freely, but aye…do you boo.  I mean that in the context of children as well.  What is the biggest thing with the head of the household? "When I speak, you listen."  I'm a legal immigrant stoic…I just speak.  I can blame this ideology on my treatment in the country, but I walked off the plane like this.  The treatment only reinforced it.  But because it's a reinforcement I have a lot more fun with it.  It's not a new lesson.  And with children, sometimes they prefer to learn on their own.  I believe in individuality, so I'm available for some things. 
        
        So Elijah Madden and I have two very different methods of tackling the same culture.  I've spent almost a decade in semen retention and in another decade I'm sure there will be more to talk about.  
        
        P.S.  I value individuality and personal experience.  No matter what my children do in life, I will always know they came from the best place possible.

        I believe in the fap.  As a boy I was conscious of the dick game.  I've always wanted mine to be on point.  I was fascinated by men who last long enough.  I wouldn't say it's about lasting hours like my blood is made of viagra, but long enough to share the experience with a female.  10 minutes…20.minutes.  I don't know…or care really. I am present, and I am diving in and out- reacting to everything she is giving.  I've even lasted 1 minute- unbothered.  The second time is always better though:).  
        
        It was 3rd and 4th year of college when I started experimenting with semen retention with edging as my guide.  I share a lot of the spiritual views that Madden commented on. I don't sleep with a lot of women because I know what it means to enter a woman.  You physically are connected. Your spiritual energy is beating those walls as well, only unlike a penis that spiritual energy penetrates much deeper.  That's the dick I actually use.  Now I don't sleep with a lot of women, but to contrast Madden I would sleep with anyone who would sleep with me.  (I don't want to explain myself because I plan to write a blog about it, but this part can be confusing.  I think there is something godly in sexual attraction.  That's all I'll say for now.) Sex, child birth, and child rearing are different things to me. 
        
        Now I'm not a perfect man.  I don't intend to be.  I'm as much of a hoe as I am a pimp. When one sleeps with a woman, yes, whatever she is you become.  But what about what I am putting into her.  I sadly don't…fully register a woman.  She is there, but we are one, so I am there.  Really it's just I. I masturbate so much that sex can feel like I'm fucking myself. 
        
        I think this goes hand in hand with a strong stoicism. I've gotten in trouble.  But nothing I wouldn't expect.  And of course I take precautions out the ass. I don't teach a course but if I did- use a condom, pull out, and put her on the pill.  If one fails, you've got two more.  I'm 29 with no kids and std's have come back negative, so I guarantee this.  
        
        But back to what I'm putting in her.  I don't think a woman should have to live a crazy righteous life for me to sleep with her. She probably fucked someone before she pulled up.  Yes, that dude is still in there.  But I don't mind. *No crossing swords.* I don't want to reject the point that Madden made. Women can be very conniving.  Despicabily so. But in life there is a constant give and take.  Like I said I stay present…through everything.  Maybe stoicism prevents me from believing in mistakes.  That's nothing that's happened that I didn't deserve.  
        
        Now it's 2022.  That's 6 or 7 years of edging.  I've reached the point where if I can "remember" lol or over power the urge not a drop will come out.  I've actually got to squeeze that bit out.  And it's only led to more discoveries.  
        
        In 2021 I edged regularly.  Maybe 3 times as much as I did in the past because I'd gotten better at it.  I came up with the plan to edge for one month straight then rest the next month and again.  Everything was going fine as long as I failed…lol. Maybe I'll bust a nut a couple times during the no nut months.  Eventually I became strong enough to go the whole month.  I haven't edged since.  Not really.  That's how hard that month was.  I had to question the health behind that method.  I did some research and maybe there was some mention of cancer.  Maybe I believe it because it was a very traumatic experience.  Blue balls maximus.  You don't know blue balls until you've given it to yourself. The results were there.  I had a male orgasm.  I think there's a difference between an orgasm and cumming.  I plan on blogging about it in the future so I don't plan to go into detail, but what a fucking treat.  But what fucking pain!   
        
        Like Madden the point of semen retention is to be a better man.  Whatever that means to you, some kind of semen retention needs to be part of your lifestyle.  Whether you can get a million women or none.  You really want to separate yourself from the female.  I'm not sure who I would be without it, but at any point in life I want to look back and say I'm better.  
        
        Now at the end I want to comment on the cultural differences between no fap and edging.  I think there could be a difference in how we rear children.  For Madden it's very head of the household.  He urges to wait until marriage. Hold out until the perfect woman. Probably with no fap.  I truly believe in that ideal.  Maybe I should say that "thought process" because in that ideal there is this image of a perfect woman.  I'm an immigrant.  I don't know who I have to be in America to get a "perfect woman" ,but I didn't know they existed.  With edging I was already committed to a single life. There's space for family but I'm high functioning.  Of course I can raise a high functioning family or a family that can orbit my functions freely, but aye…do you boo.  I mean that in the context of children as well.  What is the biggest thing with the head of the household? "When I speak, you listen."  I'm a legal immigrant stoic…I just speak.  I can blame this ideology on my treatment in the country, but I walked off the plane like this.  The treatment only reinforced it.  But because it's a reinforcement I have a lot more fun with it.  It's not a new lesson.  And with children, sometimes they prefer to learn on their own.  I believe in individuality, so I'm available for some things. 
        
        So Elijah Madden and I have two very different methods of tackling the same culture.  I've spent almost a decade in semen retention and in another decade I'm sure there will be more to talk about.  
        
        P.S.  I value individuality and personal experience.  No matter what my children do in life, I will always know they came from the best place possible.

    <div class="loveLetterText">
        In a movie a man and a woman embark on a journey of love that started when they were children.  20 years before they were running around offices, writing papers, and making deals they were kids in a park, or kids on a sidewalk, or kids doing whatever kids do to get to where the big boys are.  The big boys were up to something.  Huddled in their groups surrounded by crowds they were making noise.  Actual noise.  They were beatboxing and rhyming.
	
Their youth was set in the 1980's.  Let me apologize if I get anything wrong.  At this point beatboxing and rhyming is all it was.  The boombox had yet to be discovered (at least in the hood) and mixing, MCing, and DJing were still around the corner.  The movie was Brown Sugar, and in the first 10 minutes I saw our two protagonists get lost in the raw.  The raw is a personal term.  I use it to describe something in infancy.  The first 10 minutes I saw the birth of hip hop.  

I watched Brown Sugar maybe 2 weeks ago.  I'm never without my headphones, but I've been running away from music lately.  It's a very strong medium.  There are memories that I'm trying to bury, but Brown Sugar was too good.  It took me back, and I had to pause and make the movie even longer with an hour of Spotify.  

Now, I wasn't fortunate enough to be there myself at the start of hip hop.  My journey starts in 2003.  Around the time our adult protagonists began to discover their deeper relationship- I was discovering myself.  Music is built into the fabric of my character.  Was this accidental or on purpose, I don't know.  It's hard to avoid pop culture.  One of my earliest and most joyful memories as a child at like 8 or 9 is referencing 50 cent and having my dad look at me sideways.  "How do you know 50 cent?".  He didn't know that classroom hours were spent shouting, "You can find me in the club, body full of bud, mama I got what you need…"

I guess in a way the classroom was my ground zero.  Hip hop was frowned upon in my household.  Nevertheless when my dad was at work, the radio blared hot97.  Wayne Wonder stole my heart with "No letting go".  A man did that, lol.  It's still my favorite to this day, but there's a stiff challenge from the "I think they like me" remix of 06.  

There hasn't been much challenge since.  My relationship with music changed.  I think, as I sit here and process this, I started to use music as a container for pain.  I lost my innocence.  Music with it's variety was a good substitute.  A philosopher said, "Losing oneself can pass off in the world as quietly as if it were nothing." I forgave my innocence for abandoning me, but I resolved to protect myself.  Hip hop gave me the opportunity to experience without experiencing.  I don't know how many gun shot lyrics I heard to know to stay off the streets.  Though categorized as rhythm and blues, Usher's "Confessions" kept my mind off the sheets.  "Let it burn", "You got it bad", "Caught up" taught me how to treat and what to expect from lovers.  Justin Timberlake's "Cry me a river" taught me how to let go.  Everything from how to walk to finance I learned from hip hop.    

Hip hop flows through my veins, I can admit to being as much of an MC as the next person.  Good music can do a million things, even when you don't expect it.

                The human body, nor the human mind are responsible for the advancement of humankind.  It's attributed to the human spirit.  The human spirit has turned war into peace and set us on a path toward singularity.  It's done some pretty incredible things, but what is it exactly? I don't think I'm the best suited to answer.  Engaging with the spirit means it's hard to observe. Like a particle the human spirit is a wave.  To observe any one point is to miss the point that it's a different point.  Still, there has been plenty of great philosophy about it. 
	
Much of the philosophy I've engaged with offers meditation as a channel to the human spirit.  Practices from buddhism and daoism have it in their core, and it has penetrated into Christian medicine.  If we were computers the kernel would be the spirit.  It's always on.  Meditation is much like using the command line.   It gives a path to directly communicate with this…entity that is the human spirit.  To offer a challenger, hypnosis has the same task, but with a different method.   

I'm a few years into meditation.  It's a loving and tender relationship.  It has always been so.  The great difficulty came from patience.  The greatest benefit came from increased consciousness of the physical-mental relationship.  I was able to become conscious of being overwhelmed.  "Feeling is the key" has been my mantra lately.  It's my mantra because I'm still working on it, but before encountering it I already understood the strength behind knowing your feelings. 

My journey started from a need to slow down.  My dreams were becoming nightmares under the workload.  To manage I sat down on a hill and meditated for 10 minutes.  The work wasn't going anywhere.  It was a difficult process.  The patience wasn't there, and my mind was never up to the task.  

Discovering patience was allusive.  What is patience?  I thought about the meditating monks on television and in books, they seemed to be able to meditate for hours.  Despite my lack of ability I toughed it out long enough for my alarm to blare.    Freedom from the task brought much joy.  My body felt stronger and my mind felt light.  That feeling of lightness fueled more meditation sessions. Soon it became a commitment.  With that commitment the problem of patience returned.  Now part of my workload, I dreaded it.  It was another book to read, or another meeting to make.  I realized the first step was love.  

Love was actually the first step in a long line of steps.  Love is "I enjoy this". Before I ever began the dread crept in.  

Every sentence is packed with information.  Every feeling and experience is packed with information.  Love transformed into dread then either relief or regret.  I always chased relief, opting to put in 10 minutes everyday.  Still the dread needed unpacking.  Time.  I was scared for time.  It's what got me meditating in the first place.  Like dread, I found other negatives floating around my life.  Procrastination, tardiness, tiredness…these were staples in my life brought to light through meditation.  

Before meditation I would consider these minor details, but these are ailments of the human spirit.  Completing my workload couldn't solve these problems.  A healthy diet couldn't solve these problems.  These problems are beyond the reach of human movement.  The way to fix them is to think your way to a solution.  

My readers may want to say I'm wrong.  Meditation is about not thinking, so how can thinking be the solution?  

Meditation is about awareness.  Meditating for the awareness of a problem, is different from meditating for a solution to the problem, and those two are different from thinking about the solution.  Meditation and thinking are different sides of the same coin.  We think consciously, but something else is true with meditation.  We are instructed to do very conscious things like shut out our eyes, breathe, and cross our legs, but then something else happens. I wish I could give a different name to it.  Something happens during the course of meditation that moves you away from the state of consciousness but still grants you the ability to observe.  It's like magic, and it can flee in moment.    Think about your breath. You can feel it, but it's there even when you cannot…otherwise…death. 

It is said that meditation can change your software.  No one else can meditate for you.  This is a method where you can personally change your software.  It's not easy.  It can take months or years.  The only physical exertion is to sit.  

Lol

                I just meditated.  I sat on the floor and crossed my legs.  In recent years I’ve fallen out of love with laying down- too many naps.  I achieved a desirable position and I disappeared.  10 minutes has been my limit.  
	
Those 10 minutes are the most important moments of my day.  I’m addicted to the feeling of lightness that follows me after a successful session.  I’m not the only one.  In 2015 a mummified monk was discovered, and although good and petrified, the buddhist monks of the monastary advised the discoverers that the man was still alive!  The petrified monk entered a meditative state 200 years ago.  I’m sure the scientist-explorers who made the discovery had their reservations, but I’m on the side of the monks.   

Lately 10 minutes has been my limit.  I’m sad to admit that it’s a weaker state.  Imagine meditating for 20 minutes 3 times a day.  That’s my goal.  Still that’s lightyears away from the 200 years (and counting) that this monk committed to. 

When I first heard this story I was fascinated.  In 2015…I doubt that I was meditating.  If I was, I know I beat my alarm by 3 to 5 minutes regularly.  Never being buddhist but still using the monk as my guide I wanted to understand what would prompt a move like this.  Maybe life’s stressors prompted the decision.  If not that- maybe it was a type of protest.  Best of all- maybe he did it just to do it.  Then, apart from his reason why… I was curious of the nature of the thing.  What is it like?  The answer to that question is pure conjecture, but it brought about a view that supports my habit of meditating.  

The first thing I thought about was the man’s software.  Here I mean something other than his subconscious.  I’m talking about his environment.  Stressors and protests are external stimuli, and I like the term software because it implies something uploaded.  These uploads (especially over a long time) can affect the subconscious and cause detrimental harm.  As a practicing buddhist monk I truly feel that the man had the support to manage these uploads.  These days, in 2020, the uploads are horrendous.  They’re hidden behind entertainment and news and if great care isn’t taken you will go mental.  The Great Care that I offer is meditation.  

Owing to the movie The Matrix, the blue and red pill are staples in pop culture.  I'd like to render them differently as the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems.  Pop culture itself is an attack on the parasympathetic system.  Regardless of whether it makes you laugh or cry, it is a direct manipulation of your feelings of which there are only two, fight or flight.  Laughter, for example,  can be seen as flight.  Laugh it off while you walk away, if you can.  However; there is a saying that goes something akin to “If you do something long enough, you become that thing”.  Philosophically, this is when it affects your parasympathetic system.  Your heart beat, your subconscious breathing, blood and stimuli transport are controlled by the parasympathetic system, but so are thoughts.  One learns to get angry at the same thing that makes another smile.  Right or wrong is neither here nor there.  As human beings we have to be cognizant of creating extreme beliefs as they become part of our heartbeat.  In my experience meditation helps immensely.  Within meditation culture there are mantras.  In a lifetime of hearing others tell you what to do, a mantra is a good tool to tell yourself what to do.  

"A mantra or mantram is a sacred utterance, a numinous sound, a syllable, word or phonemes, or group of words in Sanskrit, Pali and other languages believed by practitioners to have religious, magical or spiritual powers. Some mantras have a syntactic structure and literal meaning, while others do not." –wikipedia

However, like I said, the monk was likely supported enough living at the monastery to have peace with the world around him.  My second thought was more exciting and personal.  The monk showed some personality.  He did it because he wanted to!  Is there a better reason for doing something other than the sake of doing it?  I love this answer because it puts him so close to the parasympathetic system.  I'll be blunt.  If God exists, you can find him in your parasympathetic nervous system.  If this system didn't exist we wouldn't exist beyond a clump of cells in the ocean. Faith is built into our very bodies, and it is faith that empowers the mantra that will get you where you want to be in life.  

Best of luck!

        I think I was in the 7th grade when I got the worst news ever.  Jay-Z had decided to retire.  The despair was great.  Jay Z had been a part of my life in the best way.  A year before, while everyone had iPods, I managed to get a little cd player from my dad.  The black album was one of the first cd's I owned.  It was burned by a friend, and accompanied me while I dozed during geography and math.  I was a fan of music, but albums were new.  

I've heard a lot more Jay Z since then.  You will get smart listening to Jay Z. You may even get rich.  Since 4:44, marrying and having a scandal, Jay Z has been all over pop media.  A lot of it is negative.  People don't have a lot of good things to say about billionaires.  I'll say about Jay Z, I haven't heard any album from any artist more consistently dedicated to the mental evolution of the listener.  This is true, but I had another experience listening to the Black Album as well.  From memory The Black Album was something like Jay Z's "coming out".  It was raw and very internal.  It was a mini diary.  Rather than just spit game, he shared himself.  He was already a few albums in.  It felt like he sat back and said "It's time".  It was relatable.  I felt like I knew him.  Then a year later he retired.  

School, parents, sports and throughout it all Jay Z being retired loomed in the background.  I was 13.  Jay Z was older, but old enough to retire?  I wasn't old enough to separate the money from the labor. The man is rich.  He can do as he pleases.  Then he was back. 

What!

I thought you retired!

I was 13 or 14 and my mind was going wild.  How do you tell your fans you're no longer making music, and then drop Kingdom Come (for me it was American Gangster).  

Jay Z went on to become a legend, but I do feel like he left behind a culture of retirees.  Lol.  

These retirees don't stay retired though.  Recently Jay Z shared that he left because he needed a break.  A break is a hiatus.  Many of my favorite emo bands are on indefinite hiatus.  Is it better or worse if they retire, but still leave you thinking they'll drop an album.  These muthafuckers.  

I'm not in the music industry, but the art game is a machine.  Thank God for Jay Z.  He popularized the need to step back.  If the game was only about making good music I feel like there would be a lot fewer retirees.  It's a business.   The music pays itself, but once you sign the stress kicks in.  100 plays fed you well before, but now you have to feed the machine. They're looking for 1000 plays, 10 extra shows, and hundreds of meet and greets- everything an artist could hope for.  What could go wrong? Burnout.  Weariness.  

Traveling from city to city is fun but once the burnout kicks in an artist can slip into a practically hypnagogic state.  The thing is- it's still fun.  It's exciting, but that state wears down your defenses, and the money is going up. They are going to ask for more. 

There's music, alcohol, sex, money.  Then there even more music, alcohol, sex, and money. Eventually there's just alcohol and sex and money.  The music isn't even written by you anymore. 

The machine did its job.  It spit out another successful retiree.  The machine is happy and I'm happy for it.  It isn't there to make music.  It's a cold money maker. Then the artist…did I say artist?  What happened to the art? 

A few years ago there was much hype about rappers penning their own material.  The argument was that this or this artist is using a ghostwriter.  I'm aware that rappers work in teams.  Whatever it is, I usually can identify a change in style.  The problem with ghostwriters is- how much do they influence the style.  If the artist can stay true to whatever it is that attracted me to them (and this includes experimenting) they have a fan for life.  

This is not to paint ghostwriting in a negative light.  A ghostwriter is a muse.  They offer new ideas and sounds. I don't mean to excuse any nefarious studio behavior, but the ghostwriter is the industry's connection to the material.  The ghostwriter could have the added responsibility of maintaining ad space, and protecting company integrity.  The ghostwriter is a useful tool in the machine.  However; they can be misused.  

The hynogogic state, also known as a lull, is always cured with a breath, but the moment can go by unnoticed under the many pressures of stardom.  During this critical moment an unhealthy reliance can be placed on the ghostwriter.  The machine, seeking to protect its profits, can push forward much further than the sole artist. This can rob the artist of the opportunity to heal, recover, refresh, and most importantly daydream.  

Again I say thank God for Jay Z.

It's the summer and school is out.  A young me never really had any plans.  I'm a big reader, so daily trips to the library were already scheduled.  I could kill hours there, but never 24.  The rest of my time I spent at home.   A few library books accompanied me, but my time at home was spent in front of the television.  TV shows were great.  Sometimes we had cable, sometimes not, but once Netflix became a thing the point was mute.  I think we all have had the experience of hundreds of channels but nothing to watch.  During times like this the game console saved me from boredom.  
	
A Gameboy pocket, a Playstation 2, an Xbox and then a 360 were my systems.  Adventure games kept me occupied for hours, while fighting and racing games gave me bursts of living room adrenaline.  The summers were amazing. 

I could be a warlock, a kadjit, an archer, a raceway driver, a fox with a wrench, or a super fast hedgehog whenever I wanted.  I always credit reading as the source of my desire to be an actor, but video game influence cannot be ignored.  It's all about the pixels and I am out of my depth.  I've only recently begun to understand graphics, RAM, motherboards and all the stuff that goes into the production of a console.  I barely understand, but I'm uberINSANELY excited.  

Every few years a new console is unveiled.  They offer more realistic gameplay, more games, and more experiences. The technology that I have engaged with in the last 10 years include augmented reality, virtual reality, controllers, 3D, and there are 4D gamestations on the market.  I'm a tech-head.  I'm really amateurish, but once I put on the headset, grab the controllers and start ducking and shooting (with my own body) I can't help but be fascinated.  

The technology is still really young.  The video game console may be about 60 years old, and although we have plenty of data on that…everything else that is out there hasn't quite found its home.  There is a lot of fear.  Technology is one of those topics that headbutts religion. Religion puts up a pretty good defense, but looking at things objectively- the tech is on the market.  Religion is a relationship with God and all I can say is, rather than be combative- the relationship should only influence how one interacts with technology.  There's no escaping technology.  (Of course we can always sleep beneath the stars.)

There is a new product out called the Metaverse.  It's a complicated new toy, because it's much more capable than a summer afternoon.  It's revolutionary because meta is a mix of everything that came before.  

First the hardware. The average gaming enthusiast purchases the console, controller, and display rather separately.  He must connect them together via wires.  Meta hardware is incredible because it truncates the purchases.  Specifically the display is placed on a headset, and they removed the cd changer on the console.  This reduces the weight and space.  Look at your gamestation.  There's a big block on the floor, a jumble of wires, 2 controllers (one wireless), a 40 inch TV, and 20 games or so in the second level of the entertainment center.  Now look at your kitchen table.  There's a small headset and two controllers (one for each hand).  That's it.  Maybe there is a bar for motion capture. 

I'm crazy minimalist.  And I spend a lot of time outdoors.  Please understand that we have taken the living room out of the video game. The console is now small enough to accompany you on a flight, or on a long car ride.  Why not spend a few hours shooting at the bushes on a cool evening?  I'm not designing any of this, so an objective eye is all I can offer- it seems like everything is moving handheld.  

Heldheld video games like the Gameboy or the PSP, probably got slapped around by the cell phone.  I would never let my gameplay suffer the likes of the apple store or Google play.  Those games are designed for women who are waiting outside the store while their men shop.  No.  I like real grit in my games.  A cell phone cannot cover it, and for a long time the same was true for handheld games versus consoles.  The last 15 years have changed all of that. 

The meta hardware is simple enough.  With it's reduction in space and increased travel capability it's a win-win, but the software is where things get really exciting.  

The summer died in 2016.  Sorry kids.  It's been replaced by artificial intelligence, 24 hour work days,  and nonstop engagement.   The video game is no longer a game.  It's a tool.  Facebook has plans for a metaverse and they have shown it's ability to host conferences between users.  It's nothing new…we've been doing it for decades.  In 2007 I was on my bedroom computer playing runescape, chatting about arrows and finding out where people are from.  Now I can hop on the metaverse and have conversations about real world topics.  A business meeting with a virtual trip to see the progress of the warehouse is possible. Then instead of having to get up to change the disk, in a few clicks I can be back on runescape.

Meta software affects every industry.  Every industry has the power to bend meta to its will to do some truly revolutionary things.  If these advancements don't interest you, you can always stick with the original industry, the gaming industry.  The gameplay of the future will blow your mind.

        I love to read.  Over the years it's become less of a pastime and more like a job.  I have to know things to be an artist, and I have to know even more to be a business manager.  Books offer endless amounts of information.  I've read books on how to drive, how to paint, girls, and money.  I have never picked up a book to set it down unsatisfied.  There's a trick to my reading books- it's a bit of magical thinking.  Think of your favorite person in the world- an athlete, politician, porn star…anyone.  Whatever name comes to mind, hop on Google books and search the name.  I'll bet dozens of book results spew forth.  If you are a true fan pick a book and start reading. I do this to get closer to my heroes.  Biographies (especially autobiographies) are little windows into thought processes and lessons.  I treat them like nuggets of gold.  
	
Recently I picked up a copy of My Life My Work by Henry Ford.  I'm building a company and I realized I need help.  Who better to turn to than a founder of the industrial revolution. This reading of Henry Ford is titled My Life My Work,  but for my use it could easily be titled, Henry Ford.  I didn't read it with a lesson plan.  I was attracted to the author and was only interested in what he had to say.  An interest is all it takes to follow this exercise. 

My Life My Work is a book of principles.  It's author was a very successful man.  He was a family man, business man, friend, and tycoon.  Reading about his journey was truly astonishing. 

Henry Ford was a working man.  He had an idea, and he toiled over it until something grew.  It may be too simple to say his idea was to build the greatest car the world has ever seen.  Maybe I should say sturdiest, fastest, or most economical.  Any option works, because they are all features of Ford's products.  However; before the final product we have to visit a young man.  

As a boy Henry Ford grew up fiddling with toys, no doubt breaking them and repairing them.  He was a machinist even then.  Around this time Ford was introduced to his business partner, the engine.  The relationship grew into an apprenticeship and Ford spent even more time constructing, deconstructing, and reconstructing his business partner.  The engine was Ford's biggest hurdle.  After their initial introduction there was a spark within Ford.  He envisioned a future where everything was run by machines.  I don't mean this likely.  Taken to the extreme, Ford's preface introduced a future of labor absent of mankind. This is serious.  In Ford's time he was possibly limited to imagining farm work.  Ford grew up on his family farm and was subject to the toil and labor of farm work.  He hated it.  As his understanding of engines grew he began to dream of a world where machines reduced human involvement to a minimum.  

Ford is a hero, and I have looked up to him for years.  I'm well versed in the singularity- the merger of man and machine.  Ford's vision is one step before it.  As an observer I can see that we are a long way away.  Robot taxis take over the news for a day then they disappear. Commercial drones have yet to cover the sky.  The technology is there.  I've always understood industrialism to be an explosion of machinery.  I've followed the industrial mindset with that comprehension.  However; Ford offers a higher call for us to follow.  The technology is there.  That's not a good thing.  I fear we have not incorporated the discoveries so much that research and advancement toward the singularity is a risk.  Without everything before it; Elon Musk's neuraLink is a terrifying jumble of wires and electricity.  I don't plan on brain surgery to watch more television.  

Ford turned his full attention toward the engine.  It wasn't quite what he needed it to be. We know Ford for cars, but his original intent was "to lift farm drudgery off flesh and blood and lay it on steel and motors".  I couldn't have said it better myself.  Ford may have hated toiling on the farm, but he toiled in the machine shop as well.  Adding parts,.removing parts, checking the boiler…testing the product.  Testing the product!  Ford drove his cars himself first.  Imagine that tiny of a man going full Dukes of Hazzard in the early 1900's.  Yes please!  I loved reading about his process because building a product is just a process.  He must have made a lot of mistakes because his first product wasn't ready for 2 years.  

Then there was a jump.  The horseless carriage (the car) wasn't out or successful.  The horseless carriage lived on a farm not the street.  And though the idea was out, most people doubted they would ever want to ride one.  Ford was a genius about this.  Seeing is believing.  I don't know if the saying was out then, but Ford proved it to be true. Henry Ford raced his prototypes down the streets against other machinists.  The speed, the maneuverability, the safety.  The men got excited, and looking back at history, so did the women.  

Now Ford had a product.  He started out refining the tractor, then he realized the opportunity for the horseless carriage.  After reducing weight and finding a gas source he was ready to go into business.  We all know Henry Ford as the "Assembly line man".  As a history student I always hated the assembly line.  There were too many fires and accidents, but Henry Ford knew that.  The man…according to his book…was fair.  He believed in paying decent wages.  He believed in freedom. He let his men take whatever position they chose after being hired.  He trusted his men. He went above and beyond.  The man had side jobs where disabled persons were more than welcome to work.  Henry Ford stayed true to his standard of minimal human effort.  His book makes it seem like they barely had to move a muscle.  Put a nut here, a screw there…that kind of stuff would kill me in 2022.  As an artist I wouldn't mind being with the product from start to finish,  but Henry Ford knew how to make money.  Henry Ford made his cars in bulk.  With his method hundreds of thousands of cars were produced every month, and he had the sales to support it.  Then it was time for another jump.  Ford expanded by adding traveling salesmen and mechanics.  He made himself responsible for the building, selling, and repairing of his products.  An amazing feat!  Your student applauds you Mr. Ford.

I'll end with another note.  

Friends.  Henry Ford had friends.  He would travel and go on sex…escapades.   All work and no play is not the industrial way.

        The question of the Millennials<br>

        Labeling is one of the worst things ever.  I don't think it's so much "bad"- rather it is that I like to avoid being pigeonholed.  Pigeonholed is an acting term for when an actor plays the same character type in every role.  It's like having a niche, but never learning anything else.  Niche's are great.  There's real money in being dependable at one thing.  The economy is built around that.  I apparently went against the grain.  I'm a jack of all trades.  The money comes slower, because rather than work for money, I collect skills, but most jobs require a limited amount of skill.  Therefore; I move around a lot.  I've acquired technical and managerial know-how in this way, and I pump these skills back into my company like currency.
	
Somewhere in there I defined my millennial experience.  I was born in 92.  My favorite joke is, "Can't we all just get along".  I'm online all the time.  I expect everything in 2 days.  "What a time to be alive!"!  

I stepped into the labor market at 16.  I haven't stopped working since.  I'm one of the lucky few.  My generation was indeed raped by the 2008 financial crash.  It was my second year of hs, and I saw things plummet very quickly.  From within the safety of under 18 I saw dozens of teachers and other professionals navigate life after having their financial structure crumble.  That is the economy that I and millions of other 2009-2012 students stepped into.  I kept my eyes peeled.  I needed an opportunity that would put me above the turmoil of immediate financial ruin.  I chose art.  Art is not exactly a lucrative profession, but I've always been a salesman at heart.  I can always sell my art…or someone else's.  I haven't starved.  I have no money, but I haven't starved. 

Millennials have many struggles.  By keeping my eyes peeled I managed to avoid the worst of them to become a bit of a legend in my class.  Still I fall to many others.  The biggest negative factor in the culture is eyes wide shut behavior.  "What a time to be alive" means there's always something to catch your attention.  I have a 15 second attention span.  Some of my compadres, 3 seconds.  Completely random guesses- but 15 seconds is horrible and blurting out the first thing that comes to mind every second is really weird dialog.  

Millennials have cultural ADHD.  I'm a motherfucking millennial, but I use it to my advantage.  The root of our ADHD is our ability to have whatever we want in minutes.  I spend so much time online, that I waste no time in real life.  The movie theater is…like… right in front of my face.  So are millions of restaurants.  Dating apps, porn, and virtual AIDS are a finger away.  I want what I want now, so I can get the next thing. Work is the only reason to go out, and that is where millennials lack the most.  

I was in college when my Facebook news feed started to go off about ruined superstores and various products millennials were responsible for ruining.  Their work ethic left many employers puzzled.  Eventually the millennial hate gave way to "What do you want?".  I chuckled watching videos where millennials had to translate "Weed and Pussy" into something their landlords could understand.  

The fact is there was something moving within society to make the question pertinent.  For millennials the question of their "happiness" was a hotly debated issue.  Companies want happy employees because they attract very happy customers.  But historically…"Get a new job if you're so unhappy" has always been the answer.  For millennials there was a "What can we do to make you comfortable?" attitude.  

The answer from the millennials was either lost in mumble rap or given to our god, IDGAF, because millennials were passed over and the attention quickly and naturally turned to the next generation.

        I love the States.  It's a country of commodities and luxury.  The local corner store frequently doubles as a grocery store.  They negate any reason to travel long distances and the local Walmart makes it a breeze to order online or shop in person.  The States has it all, however; I do love to travel.  Long drives though county lines out of the city and into the country have helped me breathe out a few stressors.  Longer drives out of the country have helped me understand life.
	
        I haven't been to many places. Really I haven't been anywhere- I've only visited home.  On my passport are stamps for Haiti and the Dominican Republic.  Haiti is my vacation from the states, and the DR is my vacation from Haiti.  It's an interesting relationship.  I'll probably dive into it in another blog, but regardless of where I am- I like to sit.  
        
        In Haiti my mom had a patio set up.  White iron chairs dotted the front yard embraced by her many flower pots.  During vacations it was my responsibility to water them daily.  I did so gladly.  Then I would take a seat behind the front door where a white iron rocking chair awaited me.  I would sit there for hours rocking and listening to music.  The entire time I thought to myself, "Man….this would be great if I had some…Electricity".  
        
        It's electric…boogieoogieoogie…
        
        Ever since those long summer days I've been enthralled with electricity.  It brings many luxuries.  Microwaves, refrigerators, plug outlets are everywhere in America and they make electricity as American as the American Dream, but it's suspicious in nature.  "Don't touch it!", is a wise word of caution, but as a boy I thought I touched it everyday.  I thought I was Raiden from Mortal Kombat everytime I used the remote or turned on a cd player.  That is not the case.  I am not Raiden.
        
        Electricity is a naturally occurring phenomenon.  It was discovered thousands of years ago and has held our attention since. Static electricity was the first form of electricity to be manipulated by man.  No doubt our ancestors correlated the sparks from their fingertips to the long streaks of identical blue light that fell from the sky.  With plenty of research, and a lot of repetitive information I gather that even to this day static electricity is elusive.  
        
        To see static electricity at work, grab a balloon. Rub it on your shirt for a few then hover it over your sister's head. She'll hate you for it.  You've given her an instant bedhead. The science behind the effect is simple- free electrons from your shirt transferred to the balloon.  The electrons are super tiny, and they have an equally tiny mass.  Consider that the balloon now carries the weight of those electrons.  The balloon is polarized with negative electrons.  Place it against something that has achieved equilibrium (like a soda can) and the balloon will physically attract it.  You will visually see the can rolling to meet the balloon.  
        
        For all the toasters, phones, and rocket ships electricity has helped us build, I'm most excited for static electricity.  It has this amazing ability to move things.  Consider the fact of inertia- "Objects in motion will stay in motion unless stopped by another force.  Objects at rest will stay at rest unless moved by another force".  If static electricity naturally shows the ability to move objects of small mass I can't imagine what it could do with the proper technology behind it.  Actually I can imagine it…(two words) Dead Space.  
        
        Dead Space is a video game.  The avatar uses a suit to control and move things in the environment.  It's not telekinesis.  The power didn't work on everything, but its possibilities in the real world have held my attention.  I was reminded of the game watching countless videos of scientists manipulating small objects with static electricity.  I saw the twinkle in their eye.  They're working on something bigger.  I know.
        
        Static electricity is only one piece of a bigger pie.  When I first played Dead Space I thought the power was magnetic in nature.  Then I learned about static electricity- that made more sense. Now I know they are the same.  Electricity and magnetism are of the same coin, with magnetic fields being responsible for the flow of electricity through a wire.  
        
        Before I…I guess…"explain" how that process works, I want to note that this is when the lid blows off on the topic of electricity.  It is an angelic natural phenomenon.  If cupid has a bow, electricity has the midas touch.  Everything it touches turns to gold.  Peering beyond rotating magnets we have crystals that create electricity after receiving a kinetic blow.  We can harness electricity from them.  That's amazing, but more so is the fact that every object has a magnetic field.  Crystal magic once got a huge D- from me.  The information on it is ever expanding, but we have yet to come up with a way to measure its influence.  I guess I needed a reason to believe.  I believe now.  Crystal magic gets a B+.  I no longer doubt the influences of rocks and stones on the human psyche.  The reason is that if an object has a magnetic field (and they all do)  it's constantly pulling at its surroundings.  It's attracting you, and maybe…if the desire is righteous you will attract it as well.  What could possibly be the result of both magnetic fields attracting in unison? I don't know- what I said about not being able to measure the effects is still true.  Also since we're on the topic of attraction we kind of bring up gravity as well.  I think the term refers mainly to the Earth's mass and the Sun&Moon and space and stuff…but gravity is a weak force.  It's easily broken.  
        
        Electricity is natural and by my calculation it's practically free.  An iron core wrapped with some wire, add in some magnets and spinning and you get electricity.  I've seen countless videos of people building generators(?) out of car parts or other household items.  I do plan to experiment with building my own, and until I do I can't say much more on this part of the topic.  
        
        There are other important things.  AC (power line, kill you dead electricity…it travels forward by moving back and forth…but it's apparently totally fuckwitable according to Nikola Tesla), DC (tiny power stations, it moves in one direction, if AC power lines are an eyesore- you'd still need a power station every few blocks for DC…), electricity storage (a trillion dollar business, batteries), circuitry (electronics, schematics, you can take a big amount of electricity and make it small enough for your devices). I've all very exciting.  I'm only just wrapping my head around this lovely and powerful angel.

        Heat: An appreciation<br>

        A job well done is all anyone can ask for.  

        As a producer I'm always in contact with suppliers.  I have to fix delivery dates, solve payment issues, and find the right product.  There's always a lot that I have to do in a short amount of time.  
      
        An old quote floating around my head is, "Look in the pit, and the pit looks back".
      
        Maybe it's there as an analogy for my schedule.  It's been decades since I first stood at the edge, but I've discovered that the pit has a quality of time: time spent on myself, and time spent thinking on the pit itself. One is an investment and the other is a liability.  Those expenses trigger emotions and actions that govern my life.
      
        The pit shouldn't be confused with the mountain or the cave.  The mountain is a mammoth task, while the pit is inactive and passive.  It could become a cave, but so far I've kept from falling or seeking refuge within it.  I believe every man and woman has a pit- a collection of decisions that we watch collide.  We rush to avoid the collisions but always there is another in the corner of our eye.  I dance between activity and freeze, engagement and despair.  
      
        The pit, much like the mountain and cave, is explored thoroughly by writers. In non-fiction a common term for the pit is depression.  The pit of depression is the full expression.  However; much like there is a rainbow at the end of a cave or mountain, the same is true for the pit. There is a journey involved and I have experienced it in my daily life.  I frequently congratulate myself. My pit, while as crazy and hectic and depressive as any other, it's not the most negative or dangerous.  I have a fair bit of joy when I look into it.  However, my experiences are not the topic of discussion.  Today we will talk about Neil McCauley.
      
        The film Heat is a cult classic.  I used film on purpose.  Movie doesn't seem to cover its depth.  Right away we are introduced to Neil and his buddies.  They are bank robbers, and they mean business.  The first 10 minutes is of them knocking off an armored bank truck.  I'm not a robber, and I don't plan to be, but Neil almost made me set new goals. (I may have to backtrack a few times while writing.  I'll do my best not to, but the reason is that this film is quite literally a series of moments.)  Before the heist we're given a super brief look at the relations.  Four of the five are teamsters.  They work together all the time.  The reason behind the 5th addition escaped me,  but I infer he was recommended by the fence, Nate.  The 5th addition, Waingro, hops into a dump truck driven by Michael Cheritto, and a few minutes or moments later they are ramming into the bank truck.  
      
        At this point, as viewers, we know all there is to know, but the guys are hard at work. Chris Shiherlis appears and blows open the truck doors with some kind of dynamite.  The dazed and confused guards inside are removed and placed at gunpoint.  The guard of guards is Waingro.  Neil enters the truck and he returns not with money or gold, but papers.  
      
        This brings me to my first bit of commentary.  First, it is revealed later on, the dynamite used on the truck was untraceable because it was so common.  Of course you have to know what your doing, as Chris did, but there is something special about that comment. Maybe it's common sense, but I've stored that info up for a rainy day.  I don't know when, but it'll come in handy in other situations. Next, money was untouched.  Upon delivery of the goods an elaborate insurance scheme is revealed.  I couldn't follow beyond the first two layers.  First, Rodger Van Zant, actually paid the crew to steal his own papers.  He'll file insurance to collect some money, then buy back his stolen property.  That's already a 150% profit, then there's more flipping after that.  I told you it was elaborate.  
      
        Back at the truck Waingro had- what I learned to call by the end of the movie, a Waingro moment.  He murdered the first security.  The second made a move, but Waingro was covered by his teammate.  Then the call was made to kill the third.  No money.  No gold.  But a bloodbath nonetheless.  Then they split.  
      
        This shooting stood out to me not only because of Waingro, but also because of the police reading the scene completely wrong. The police noted the money was untouched.  The robbers were looking for something specific.  They can identify an assassination, but what triggered it was complete conjecture.  It's like even the police couldn't believe the security guards were popped like that.  It didn't fit the modus operandi. I say this because I saw no move from any guard that prompted the first shooting.  The police determined the first guard made a move for his ankle holster and things went bad from there.  That's not true.
      
        Neil didn't believe it to be true either. He arrived at the safe haven (a diner) with his trunk tapped up.  He was to kill Waingro, but a bad series of events led to his escape.  
      
        So far these events have occurred about ten minutes into the movie.  After the failed Waingro murder attempt Neil's pit began to show.  He is the mastermind and within the pit are his 3 buddies, his fence, Waingro, and his next target.  That's his life.  He lives it alone.  Through Waingro, we see Neil as a man of action.  He gave the order to kill the last security guard.  He is the one responsible for aborting a failing mission.  He is the one calling the shots. He also puts himself into the lives of his comrades.  He runs damage control between Chris and his wife.  Neil is in control of everything- even if it's just dinner with the team and family. When I picture Neil standing at the edge of the pit, there are minimal collisions.  Rightfully so!  Any collision could cost him his life.  This is Neil.  He keeps everything in check, but the quote is "Look in the pit, and the pit looks back".   Do well- the pit is watching.  Do poorly- the pit is watching.  For Neil, a pitbull by the name of Vincent Hanna had him in crosshairs.  
      
        We first see detective Hanna as an almost father to a troubled young girl and an almost lover to a wife.  Detective Hanna has a pit of his own.  He loves his work, but standing at his own pit he does his best to steer the drudgery of his work life away from his private life.  He is successful to a fault.  His wife, with needs and a pit of her own, requires more from him.  His face is forever gaunt with bad news and his lack of sharing makes her feel left out.  Hanna explained his pit clearly.  "You want me to tell you about two junkies who put their baby in the microwave because it was crying too loud."  He cannot.  I could barely type it without vomiting.  Instead he throws himself into his work.  When the bank truck case slams on his desk he gobbles it up. There is an anger in him and work is one of the best outlets for it.  He follows the procedure.  It's the center of his pit, but like oil in water, vital nutrients are pushed to the outer edges.  
      
        We've only covered 10 minutes of the story so far.  Here's more.  Neil finds a heart in his pit.  He sparks up a serious romance with Eady.  Romance explains itself, but I doubt it regularly finds a place in Neil's pit.  Eady slips through, but Neil's got a mission.  He expects payment for his last job, but instead receives assassins. After a quick phone call Van Zant knows he's on his deathbed.  We start to see collisions.  The heat is on.  
      
        I watched the movie on YouTube.  Luckily it was free and good quality.  The comment section stated, "I'm not sure there has been a heist action film that examines the spouses of the leads like Heat."  It's my second time watching the movie so I was able to notice and agree with that statement.  While the men had pretty much the same attitude, the women were differentiated.  Eady was taken over by the roller coaster of Neil's life. Charlene understood Chris' financial woes. Diane's daughter stood apart because she was the young person in the film.  I expected some innocence but right away is a teenager sobbing over a missing scarf.  I checked her as a teenage miscreant until she sobbed over being late for a rendezvous with her dad.  Who never showed.  She attempted suicide, wrist and thigh.  
      
        I mentioned the men had much the same attitude.  This is true for everyone except for Waingro.  (Or maybe Waingro parallels the others more below the surface.)  The man who I witnessed kill an unarmed guard, then kills a prostitute.  Then he kills a member of Neil's team.  For Neil, the collisions have been increasing.  The pressure is up.
      
        After discovering the murder of his getaway driver Neil is determined to kill Waingro after Van Zant.  It's good to question whether he actually meant to slip out of the country but decided on revenge.  A famous line for me is, "There's time".  He says this to Eady.  She is in the car and they were headed to the airport, home free, then Neil decided to run the errand.  It never felt like one choice or the other.  He only moved to avoid a collision.  It worked.  He killed Waingro, but right away another collision.  
      
        Detective Hanna is there.  Eady is there too.  Neil had no choice.  He had to run.  
      
        Within Neil's guidebook he keeps, "Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walkout on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.". It sounds like advice.  I wondered if he fell short when he decided to date and runaway with Eady.  I decided that love is always innocent, and no matter how black and bleak my pit, I can't fault it.  He hit the race in 30 seconds.  The other option was to stay and be arrested in front of her.  
      
        The final moments of the film are iconic.  Neil and Hanna hold hands.   While one dies, the threat is neutralized, and compassion shines.  It's the picture of two men set in their ways, but their livelihoods are interconnected.   They enjoyed the chase, and I don't think either has regrets.

        A response to the millennial question<br>

        It's 2023.  Millennials are in the workforce.  So much so that now the attention is on the next generation.  Millennials find themselves combating long work hours, shitty bosses, and stagnant pay. They come from a place of hate.  Some of it is natural.  Millennials are the richest generation yet.  The successes that came before made it so, but those who slacked before outnumber them.  Therefore millennials are faced with a peculiar kind of hate.  It's the kind of hate one has when they must depend on you.
	
  It's a big task for millennials.  In 2010 24 year old fresh faced graduates were placed 
in charge of multibillion dollar  corporations.  Their assistants were people who had been in company positions for 20,30,40+ years. Their opinion was that no baby faced prick could tell them what to do.  Let's focus on these guys for a minute.  Those who had been around for 20-40 years had been through it all- wars, recessions, lay offs, divorces, bankruptcy, deaths, everything.  The company was formed by their hands.  The lovely pay offered to the newcomers was made off their backs.  

  Jealousy has one root, why.  "Why hire a millennial from the outside when an expert is somewhere on the shop floor?" "Why was I passed up for this position?"  "Why must I listen to you when I've done this for 20 years." The bookworms weaseling their way into the company have no idea what it really takes.  Sometimes books don't hold the full story. They don't know Eric can't sell X for whatever reason even though it's listed in the operation manual. "Eric we have to let you go", and now there's a riot because Eric is not a unique case. 

  The millennial boss is the enemy.   It's the prevailing sentiment in the current culture of the United States.  I'm a millennial, and I find it hard to handle.  If we look back at Eric, there are a million factors that affect work production. Some of these factors have nothing to do with the work itself.  Millennials are berated by their co-workers for things they cannot know.  I have been through this myself.  In any company experience is key. Out of respect I understand the hate.  The contributing factors are real, and the biggest factor is a lack of experience on the part of the millennial and a lack of patience from the co-workers.  

  To speak up for millennial's I'll say, "Give us the time".  Many times I've walked into a factory and they expect me to meet quota immediately.  I've been expected to do everything experienced workers do.  I resist frequently.  Mistakes are costly and I find it better to walk out than cause a billion dollar wreck. I have that luxury. Many do not, but I know the many.  I know how they were raised.  I know the fire of 9-11, the 2008 crash, and a two or three theater war in the Middle East.  I also know the music, the movies, the schooling, and the technology millennials are entitled to. We have pain and joy.  

  To move forward the first step is to know where you come from. The second step is to never let it go.  When you know who you are, and you ALWAYS always know who you are, you have to claim it.  When you know what you want, you have to claim it.  Then the struggle begins. The struggle should be afraid, right?  Rich and poor in America, we grew up fighting.  In the black community, "How many of your homies are dead?". In the white community "How many of your friends commited suicide?".  In the immigrant community, "What did it take to get here?"  In the United States we are born to struggle, but It's hidden by our joy.

  The Struggle is the backbone of the States.  How often do you think about your backbone? (You should think about it more)  The answer is never.  We don't think.  We get buck. We go out and have a few drinks.  We hang onto our phones playing games and talking to friends about absolutely nothing.  We chew the shit.  We're good at it.  A millennial can be anywhere in a few minutes.  Thank the ones who came before.  A millennial has credit cards and access that makes poverty non-essential.  Thank the ones who came before. A millennial has education at their fingertips.  Thank the ones who came before.  
Therefore, when the ones who came before try to get buck, we should thank them.   

  Millennials are missing an attitude of gratitude.  We are very entitled.  Who else can be expected to manage these companies at such a young age.  Those that came before understand this.  I taught my mom Facebook back in 2016.  I taught my dad the computer a few times growing up.  They were surprised- like I was the one who created it.  No, but it's ours.  It's in our blood and fingertips.  We can manage. We know a new piece of tech like the back of our hand because it was passed down to us for that reason.  Those that came before understand their anger is different.  In 2010 and onwards we are focused on recovery from the 2008 crash.  This means new technology and machines.  Software that you'll have to go back to school for knowledge on how to use it.  Lol.  Who had just walked out of school?  Millennials.  Who took over businesses run by people twice their age, millennials.  

  It's scary.  We don't really talk.  We text and stare at our phone all day.  We grew up hardly making eye contact.  I'm different in a few ways because I dedicated myself to the theater, but I have exactly the same issues.  
It's a bit ridiculous to think of us falling.  Failing.  It's ridiculous to me to think of us not standing up for ourselves when that's what we do.  It's not all bad.  A specific work ethic was passed onto us by our parents.  They lived in a time where companies were expected to last forever by either dying with the owner or being passed on to the protégé.  That doesn't exist for the millennial.  We were placed where we were for our fingertips.  We have very experienced fingertips, and business is different.  Check the terminology.  We've been creating business for 6000 years, what the fuck is a start up?  It's a different time and the world needs to keep going round and round.  If we didn't fight growing up, we wouldn't be in these positions.  To fight is the only way forward.  We'll gladly fight with any piece of software.  As long as the code is correct, it'll do what we tell it.  To fight with our co-workers, especially older subordinates, we need to understand the strength that we add to the company.  A millennial death is upon us. With it is a generation of kids who grew up in the rain and sun, sweaty and bloody, who never gave a fuck, and always wanted to have fun.  We are the bosses.

        Let's get meta ladies and gentlemen. 

Back in 2018 I had to take a break from social media.  I was building an artistic page much like now, except my friends list were industry or future industry.  I was content producing monologue video's and photography but I had a direction that would take me through my current page and beyond.  As my personal life caught up to my ambitions I needed to take a step back.  Sharing for all to see on social media proved detrimental to myself and my career.  It's not something I predicted.  I either blew up too fast or too slow- either way things grew out of proportion and I needed to take a step back.  
	
I moved my art onto the street.  I did a project called community canvas where I asked the community to finger paint on a little $10 canvas as I told them about my company.  I had no money and I used construction paper for business cards.  It was something cute.  There was more to the project but my financial situation caught up to me and I lost the canvas.  After that I turned my attention to designing a few facemasks.  It was a small project to capitalize on the mask mandates from the coronavirus Era.  That project is still alive and well.  Toward the end I began to think about social media again.  It's not that I wanted to- I'm building a company and having some online presence is important.  Even during community canvas people wanted to know where they could go to see more of my work.  My Facebook and Instagram were deactivated.  I had nothing to show them.  That devastated me, but after my previous experience with social media I wasn't eager to hop back on the train.

My experience with social media can parallel the experience of others.  "That food looks great…but is it really worth a picture?"  "Why…are all of these pictures…of your face, and whose bathroom is that?"  However; I'm a content creator as well.  I can understand the need to snap that pic and post it for likes and attention.  I'm an actor at heart.  I love likes and attention, but from the onset I noticed the hysteria.  I'm a functioning artist, likes and attention do not govern my movements. I need a deeper motivation.

In 2021 Facebook unveiled Meta.  I was fascinated by the prospect of a living avatar.  Not only a bitmoji, but one that moves when I move.  One that can copy my facial reactions and convey them in real time to other avatars.  I'm an actor- all I need is a stage, and "All the world's a stage." Jaques' timeless monologue falls a bit short.  These days the whole World Wide Web is a stage.  Eliminate the opportunity for gaming and business- I know a couple people who can really F it up in a meta environment.  

Afterwards I really wanted to get involved in meta.  I wanted to be there at the forefront of the battle to turn it into popular culture.  I chose my war- so to speak.  I started another project called Imp.  Project is too weak a word for it. I've got a super young company on my hands, and I'm looking at being relevant 20 years down the line. I have the time to develop the skills needed to develop a meta environment of my own, but the idea starts now, and it starts with Imp.

            09/15/2022
            
            War!  It's full of explosions. Bullets are flying everywhere.  Stick your helmet out and you'll catch a bunch of lead.  You've got to run from cover to cover and you've got to keep your head low.  This was my mindset in 2009.  I was 15.  I wasn't in Iraq, Afghanistan or even Haiti. I was in the United States.  Still I felt like I was going to war.  
            
            At 15 I had made a commitment.   "I will succeed", I said to the mirror.  "Give me the Oscar", I said to the brightest star in the night sky. I walked my path in the late hours of the night.  I lost myself in bus routes.  Somehow I always made it to my destination.  It was magical indeed.  
            
            My commitment wasn't easy…Or maybe it was.  You see, certain things are simple.  It was easy to make the commitment- to say the words and make the wish, but the journey didn't end there.  At that point the journey had barely begun. 
            
            "How do I become an actor"?  From my father's perspective the answer was easy…"You don't".  You become a doctor or lawyer or engineer.  For my Haitian upbringing you can change those "or"'s into and's.  
            
            I weighed my father's wishes against my own.
            
            "That's decades of education." 
            
            I've got decades.  I can take the time to do this for myself.  The culture can wait.  
            
            No matter my experience with my father he was supportive…in his way.  I always thought I sidestepped him like any other wide eyed child set on a goal.  I gave myself a longer tether, but now I had to look elsewhere for advice.  
            
            The internet was my first stop.  
            
            I'll note that I had already run through the library.  I was collecting monologues and practicing them in my spare time. I recorded them into a journal to save for later.  The internet was a good place because you learn the business side of things.  It has very little to say about the craft.  (I was very fortunate that my interest started with a broken wrist.  No PE for me. I spent weeks crying about it before I cracked open my first book.  I haven't put them down since.)
            
            Surprisingly Charlotte, North Carolina was a great resource.  There were dozens of films being shot and hundreds of free web pages listing casting notices, classes and most importantly tips.  The number one resource was The Actor's Grapevine. On its scroll down post system was everything I mentioned.  I was on there daily to check casting notices and not long after I first discovered the website I took off on my first deployment.  
            
            I collected my tips from all over the internet, but I'll attribute all of them to the Actor's Grapevine.  It was that good.  I remember being very prepared for the environment.   The audition was at Spirit Square.  I had  classes there freshman year, so I had no problems navigating to the proper place.   I remember being early.  As I walked up the stairs a man followed behind.  I paid him no mind.  I assumed he was another auditionee.  The sign in sheet wasn't out yet.  I was early, early.  
            
            As the man (now I remember his satchel) found himself a seat I noticed another person.  I immediately knew she was another auditionee, but she was…different.  Not quite what you would expect.  I never expect to meet all bombshells and gorgeous girls. It's not exactly why I choose theater.  Instead, I always expect to meet the right person for the job, but this is an audition and no one "" is hired yet.  
            
            She said ,"Hello".  We had a bit of conversation and I noticed she has aspergers.  
            
            Let me take a moment to comment on why "War" was my mindset rather than a…"first audition".  I'm Haitian in North Carolina.  I'd been there for maybe 2 years.  I was picked on heavily in middle school- I had dropped the balls and picked up the books and people noticed.  I came from a two summer stint in Haiti- again people noticed.  I was always comfortable but I had no money.  I had everything against me.  I never expected to succeed except through hard work.  On my side were two wins- I had been in front of an audience before; Governing Alice in 8th grade, and I was accepted into Northwest School of the Arts after auditioning.  I had two performances already.  
            
            Now…in the privacy of arriving 30 minutes before my first audition…I notice aspergers.  All of the thoughts went through my head, but I held onto one.  It wasn't even my thought.  It was a tip from The Actor's Grapevine.  "Be careful what you say in the audition environment, because you don't know who is listening."  Thoughts aside, we had a conversation that I appreciate to this day.  Remember I'm Haitian.  I didn't exactly expect kindness and it was my first audition.  She was the sweetest. 
            
            During the conversation more people arrived. They set up. I finally signed in, and found a corner to mumble my monologue to myself.
            
            Something fantastic happened when they called for the auditions to begin.  The man with the satchel stood and walked into the room.  I thought he was first, but  he was on the other side of the table while I gave my performance.  
            
            I was awestruck.  Was this the director?  Clearly he was part of the casting process.  Clearly he could have witnessed a blunder had I chosen to behave rudely.  
            
            I did not receive a call back.  The confirmation date came and went with no email.  
            
            I wasn't heartbroken.  I went out and I tried again, and again, and again.  
            
            I have booked again and again and again.

        You ever open your eyes and see stars….let me explain.  

        For the last two years I've been in a unique position.  I have no home.  That's the easy answer.  What is complicated is my solution to this problem-  I turned the world into my home.  What's the answer to "Where am I going to sleep tonight?"  Anywhere.  It's the greatest answer ever imagined.  
        
        How have I accomplished this feat for the last two years?  A lot of trial and error.  Two years ago I realized I had to leave New York.  I failed at becoming a resident. I had to run.  My greatest benefit is that I'm a day laborer. I never just "run", I always run to the bank.  I needed financing.  You may think by bank and financing I was looking for a loan.  Not quite.
        
        I am a Buster in Green Artiste Noir art collective. Buster is one of many monikers the company uses.  It's short for "I bust my ass".  Luckily, as a member, money is never much of a worry.  To continue I have to reveal another moniker, CREATOR.  As the first and only current member of GAN it's one of my powers.  It's my responsibility to create the culture.  "We make art" is the message from the CEO.  My job is to figure out how. 
        
        The task is daunting, but with guidance from the CEO I've been able to get things bubbling.  This question of "Where am I going to sleep tonight" was one of the very first questions to answer.  When I became a buster I was sleeping in a homeless shelter.  While I appreciated the respite from the infamous NY winter, the demands of the company require a massive amount of travel. GAN demands experience.  I knew I wasn't going to get it in a shelter.  Therefore; without knowing whether I should go left or right I left the shelter and left NY.  
        
        Where did I first sleep?  I don't remember.  I do know that it was cold.  (I'm kind of freaked out that I don't remember)  Although I joined GAN in 2019, the company was on my mind years before, but I chose to pursue a career as an actor rather than join right after college.  It wasn't a mistake.  I don't regret my decision.   A lot of my responsibilities as CREATOR were already complete, but I was focused on acting.  GAN is a lifelong passion.  I expected to join in my 40's after acting, but I failed at that in the beginning.  I went cold, and that's death for an actor.  New York was colder and GAN was the only thing there for me.  It was also the farthest thing from my mind.  
        
        I slipped into emergency mode.  
        
        I worked one hundred and one odd jobs, and was fired from all.  I sat in that shelter quite lost until I rediscovered the path.  I mention acting and GAN as separate things, and they are, but they are not.  My mistake was waiting.  I had the option to immediately reinvest into the company, but I was waiting.  Income is as important as artwork in GAN.  Either way you have to bust your ass.  Luckily the realization that everything I need I have dawned on me.  In that position I left NY.
        
        I jumped headfirst in GAN.  I worked and my first purchase out of $100 was a sleeping bag.  I slept in parks for a few days before my next check came in.  I was super excited.  My next purchase was a tent.  I'll admit to trial and error and say that currently I'm in my third repeat of this part of the process. 
        
        Again I'll ask if you ever open your eyes and see stars, because I have.  With the repeats I'm still in the very beginning, but it's the greatest beginning ever.  I went to sleep in Pennsylvania and woke up in Boston.  In between I dreamed of cop cars and homosexuals.  I felt the sun behind my eyelids and the cold chill on my spine.  Like magic my shadow reached out and enveloped me.  I can feel its warmth.  It's taken possession of my legs and moves them freely from here to there.  Above me reminders twinkle as time passes.  To be anywhere is to be here, but to be there is everything.

        Lately a fascination with machines has been creeping around my life. It's like when I was a child and I would undo screws.  I usually stuck to cabinets and wood, but the interest was there. 

        Screwdrivers and saws, hammers and hatchets are fascinating.  Not because of what they can do, but because of what I cannot.  I chuckled plenty during my study of simple machines.  The excitement over "superhuman strength" was evident, but I've  been appreciative in a more natural sense.  I've always appreciated the thumb.  I see it as the source of our ability to use these machines (imagine teeth, or claws…dafa…fins?).  
            
        Try to push a nail in with your thumb.  
        Now use a hammer.
        Tools are awesome!  Machines are incredible! We see them everyday! They are everywhere!
        
        I'm on an engineering and design path and understanding simple machines and materials immediately shifted how I view tools.  Lol…it's very difficult to interact with materials as a naturalist.  It contradicts the live and let live attitude, and to engage you need another object (and gloves:)). 
        
        I've concluded that the human world runs on a few machines that were built using a few tools, and I learned to simplify machines away from complex code down to a simple lever.  Along the way I realized that all of man's creation is a machine.  Things didn't start in the 1970's, and software is far from the pinnacle of technology.
        
        My smart phone gets a lot of attention because it is the latest and hottest tech gadget, but machines are not limited to electricity.  The bandaid is a close friend of mine, and as an actor I always enjoyed the push vacuums of the 1960's; it had a twin used in yard work.  By this point in my life I know they are "machines", but machines actually being made of smaller machines (rather than tools) is knowledge to me.  I'm still digesting it.  
        
        I think a lot about the objects I hold in my hand.  Is it a tool or machine?  What material is it?  How was it made?  
        
        There's an object that hasn't touched my hand yet, but it's hard to ignore because it's on the news almost everyday.  Almost everyday I suffer through the news of gun violence. The Japanese Prime Minister was just shot, and 33 New Yorkers went through it over the weekend.  These are front page headings.  I find myself wondering where the gun fits in the machine.  
        
        To answer a situation with a gun is to say I have the right to end your life.  The right exists, but it's withheld until the very last moment.  The social/legal relationship for self defense points the answer to nowhere.  Guns have no place in society.  Guns don't just appear at the proper moment.  They are on hips, and in trunks hours before the altercation. 
        
        I whip a fat knife.  I put it on daily.  I entertain the idea of using it.  I train it.  I have indeed used it…but I never THINK I will.  I must be an idiot having a weapon that I barely know is there!  Is this the same perspective as gunslingers?  What if instead of a knife I used a screwdriver?  What if in my next fight I defended myself with a saw?  I like the knife.  It's good for distance.  Best of all…it's easy for me to imagine it as a tool. 
        
        I wondered if the same couldn't be done with a gun.  The difficulties come quick.  First issue is the very function of a gun. It's aim is to kill.  As I sit and fight for a decent life, do I want to consider killing?  Naturally I don't.  
        
        Also- it's hard to be a naturalist in society.  
        
        The gun's function, which is a mean killing machine, doesn't make it less of a tool to the man in need. Like my pressing of the nail, maybe he found his strength alone wasn't enough.  He needed the gun to bring forth a powerful ally- confidence. 
        
        My knife is for an unknown enemy. I do not know who I'll have to use it on or when, but I do know it is there.  If the argument for the gun as a tool remains strictly defensive, the confidence that comes from just having it is enough.  
        
        But that is not my argument.  
        
        My answer to the gun question is to treat it as clothing.  "Clothing makes the man".  Clothing falls under the tool category and it keeps us warm or cool.  This morning I took great care to choose mine.  Then I put my knife on me.  I don't feel the immediacy needed for self defense.  I don't feel like I'll get robbed in the afternoon.  I do feel like a pair of Nikes.

        The penis is a man's best friend, and before any doggo gets mad, it'll add "barring any company".  It's there through thick and thin and if "the body keeps the score" the penis has Google RAM on speed dial.  It goes through a lot.  It can sit there bouncing along during your gym routine or it can sit there bouncing along during a business conference.  Like a good friend after a rough year- it's important only that they're there.  
	
        Ball's out!
        
        A fairly terrifying piece of advice for a young man.  Though it references an area slightly lower than the actual penis, most references tend to include both the ball ,and chain.  I love penis references.  I love penis jokes.  There's always a genuine "ouch".  It's like a reminder, "This feel good, but if you push too far…".
        
        A good penis joke, or even a simple story about a boy and his beanstalk helps to prepare a young man for adulthood.  Therefore by young adulthood a "Dick" by another name has had numerous preconceptions on what to expect and what to offer to society.  A good Dick offers his best.  That's rule number zero.  Other rules really stem from a clash between that offering and expectation.  
        
        Expectations arise.
        
        "As a Dick I want to do my best but there was a lot on my plate yesterday and more keeps getting piled up."  Rule 1-1 million is that Work begets Work.  Once the offering is made (and it's "free" to make) the expectations will never cease.  The whole world wants someone willing to do their best.  That someone is in high demand, but it is expected everyday.  It can be a parent, spouse, or lover- they have expectations and they expect to have them met.  That's not a problem for the good Dick- until Mom, Wife, and Work, need Dick, at the same time. 
        
        We're talking about good Dick.  Good Dick knows to take some time off when family, home life, and work get crazy.  (Emphasis on good Dick).  I can't tell you what Dick does alone- if I did I'd have to kill you, but whatever it is Dick comes back sharper and with a game plan.  He gets to work on the problems knowing that there will be others, but at least he took a moment to breathe.  
        
        When I'm alone I always find myself sitting with my problems.  I think lonely Dick finds himself in the same position.  Men are defined by action, and man is spurred to it by those around him.  The absence of company can be therapeutic but it can become a cage where men lose hope.  If my own action can be a guide, in these times Dick seeks out Dick.  
        
        Socially we think of time in chunks.  We remember that time when we were depressed or that time when we were happy for 6 months straight.  That's not the case.  If we pay close attention we have massive waves of emotions all throughout the day.  The moment where family or work overwhelmed may have only been a moment, but in that moment you retreated mentally to your cabin.  It was the quickest reprieve, but maybe what you were looking for wasn't there- a quick glance to a co-worker buddy.
        
        Frat house!!
        
        Your cabin has disappeared.  Your loneliness has disappeared.  Family is forever important but what you're running from (responsibility) is amongst them.  You've replaced them with keggers, a few college friends, one childhood buddy, and office mates.  The party is on.  The dicks are out!  Out! Out comes the measuring tape.  This party can go on forever.  For some of them it does.  For the good Dick it was only a good time.  He slips back to his cabin, then back to his house.

    An Insane Review<br>
    Boublog<br>
    By Ian Fermy<br>
    10/16/2022<br><br>

    <div class="cuckooText">

        A great movie has reared its head.  It's a steaming hot pile of social commentary, and it's for the boys.  This movie champions rage and lust in no better place than the psych ward.  The location is worth mentioning.  Like the ring to a fighter, it identifies a space where what is outside is an afterthought.  Inside there is no bill, no work, no problems.  

        "You mean to tell me you're all here by choice?"  
        
        The movie starts with a new arrival and a question of insanity. "You are sane," the doctor prompts the man.  The statement is neither confirmed nor refuted, but the man does not leave.  Instead he becomes a kind of sheppard for the spiritually devoid and demoralized patients.  Quickly, and not so quietly, the man tries to herald the other men into throwing off the shackles of their torment. His moves are observed by none other than the infamous Nurse Ratchett.   
        
        What kind of name is Ratchett for a nurse to have?  It's terrifying.  It's like a teacher named Pencil, but a ratchet is a tool used mostly by men to assist in a "tightening". In a way Nurse Ratchett and her orderlies fulfill a specific task offered by the patients of her hospital.  They asked her to keep them safe.  Unlike our newcomer many of the patients are there by choice. They are a ditzy bunch, but non violent and "safe".  They did not ask to help keep them safe, only that she keep them safe. They are runners.  The bills piled up, the work was too strenuous, and the problems overbearing.  They needed an escape. 
        
        Our newcomer seeks to throw a wrench at Ratchett.  He cannot stand for drudgery when it surrounds him.  "Play ball," he says! He escapes.  He commendeers. He invites. He does everything wrong?  Except he is still where he was in the beginning- in the psych ward. 
        
        The story in terms of screen time and lines point to the newcomer as the protagonist despite his antagonizing the other patients.  I guess he did it for the greater good, but I will offer a different perspective-  Ratchett is the protagonist and he the antagonist.
        
        Ratchett is not without her faults.  Shockingly there is a suicide and her response is "Let's get back to what we always do".  This prompts a physical attack from my antagonist. 
        Ratchett is not perfect.  At times she behaves dumber than her clients.  Why have daily meetings aimed at lifting your patients if you know they don't care?  Why the medication or why even bother showing up at all?
        
        In combat the ring doesn't just serve to stop fighters from falling out.  The ring and the four walls of the psych ward have another manifestation- the Law.  Nurse Ratchett has a job to do.  Although many patients are free to go, they have made a request and it's legally supported.  Nurse Ratchet has a specific list of things to do, and deviating from it could land her in a ward of her own.  The party hosted by our newcomer could have easily been her undoing.  The stealing of the bus should have been her undoing.  
        
        For my antagonist the attack on Nurse Ratchett ends with a vegetable for man.  Overall I can say he was well intentioned, but his motive was never discussed.  There was a short sightedness to his methods.  The men were fine where they were, but he didn't respect that, and then his actions contributed to a suicide.  
        
        This movie is a masterpiece.  Masterpiece's usually have an extra kick that your favorite doesn't.  In this movie the plot goes absolutely nowhere, yet all faults contribute to its mastery.  Nurse Ratchett has no character development which breaks the rule for a protagonist.  My antagonist plays the hero, albeit a little too selfishly, but he is the likeable character.  He walks a very fine line.  I can see the "man-trap" in his behavior, but he does have a breakthrough.  A silent Indian who everyone assumed couldn't speak English, spoke the clearest English in the entire movie.  
        
        One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the perfect representation of Man's struggles.  In it we see Man struggle with himself, others, and authority.  I include Nurse Ratchet in Man.  She is unique. In her character I see a woman who wishes she could do more, but unlike our newcomer, she knows not to.  She knows her clients better than I and he.  They will not leave unless they want to.  I see gratitude when she eyes our newcomer trying to rouse spirits on the basketball court.  I don't remember him being chastised for it.  I do remember the perfect worker. Maybe that is her fault- she never took any of the risks our newcomer took.

This is for imagined touches and all but real kisses.  You'd think that I'd wait until Valentine's day for a post like this, but with respect to Halloween there is an aspect of fear, maybe enough to persuade you to go to that party as your crush.  
	
Dundundun

I love a good heartbreak.  I love a good crush.  A crush is more special.  It's more pleasant, for sure.  You're in control, but random hallway hellos carry you to your next class on a cloud.  It's so very one sided, because a crush is only a crush in secret.  You're one word away from heartbreak…"eww".  Baring the games we play to get a temperature feel, we hold our crushes dear.  

I remember feeling flush when my crush was near.  I remember the dreams that warned me that I had a crush.  It's not always clear.  Why this person?  What's this feeling?  A true crush is not so common.  It's not like flirting.  It's a youthful exercise, and psychologically it probably helps you to understand your own psyche rather than the art of pursuit.  I remember the lingering touch of a two second crush.  It was only a day at the park or beach, but I'd never see them again.  The goodbye lasted forever in the words "bye" and "see you later".  

I remember slightly older crushes.  The familiarity of the feeling coupled with "my friends can't know, cause they would eat me alive". It was a manner of speaking, a way of walking, an energy that set me ablaze. No one else would understand.  As you get older the walls close in.  Sometimes you're stuck wondering…thinking.  

We age and become old.  We know what's ours and what's not.  This doesn't stop a crush though.  Everyone laughs at a particular behavior, and you do too- while clutching your heart.  God forbid you find competition in the crowd.  Your secret crush has a crush.  

I've bit my tongue and hid quivering lips before. I've pulled myself together many times.  I've asked myself why the tears?  It was only a crush.  A crush is everything. It's more sex than actual sex.  It's more work than an actual relationship. It's knowing someone without getting to know them.  We don't always have the balls, luxury, or money to make an introduction.  Yet God still finds a way to expose private parts.

        The Secret<br>
        BouBlog<br>
        By Ian Fermy<br>
        11/06/2022<br><br>

        The human body is a steller organism.  It's been studied by the best and painted by the amazingly talented.  Through it we see God's hand at work, and His hand is my standard for perfection.  His design is so precise that I know even what I consider to be "mistakes" are examples of perfection. It liberates and sobers me as I flick through TV channels and browse through social media.   However; this relief doesn't release me from my personal and social responsibility.  I believe perfection is within me and it is my business to show it.  Failure is not an option.  
	
        I watched a movie earlier today where a simple mistake almost cost thousands of lives.  This is a situation that has played out in my own life in the form of near deaths and accidents.  Hindsight has been a faithful guide as I proceed through life ever more cautiously. However; hindsight is indeed 20/20. I wear glasses.  I don't always see ahead clearly, and my choices reflect that.  To counter this I use God's perfection as my guide post.   Christians and Godly folk alike will celebrate that statement, but all is not well.  I have 100 years to God's eternity.  To follow behind that is daunting.  Yet, He asks for nothing, and leaves time to wash away my sins; therefore, the path to perfection is well lit.  
        
        The path is lit, but littered.  Perfection is the infamous "no".  Perfection is "Actor's don't need water".  Perfection is "One more rep".  Perfection is "Another 10 minutes on the court". Perfection is tough.  The only one who's mastered it had all the time in the world to do so.  
        
        Still I try.  I become anxious and angry, edgy and distant.  I've been associated with a "spaceship".  I don't mean to be so aloof.   I do mean to get my lines down and it's possible I'm running them in my head. To be associated with a spaceship is a great mistake.  With perfection there is the mighty "I am" and the great "Here".  They deserve perfection as well.  That is: be who you are, perfectly; be where you are, perfectly.  
        
        There are public speakers who make their living helping others make millions.  These are the self help books- Tony Robbins and pastors come to mind.  Then there are those books that feed another part of us- the part that usually dies when we gobble up huge wads of cash.  Earning money is no doubt a symptom of perfection.  Noone will ever persuade me otherwise.  A well thought out and executed plan is a money machine and anything else is an expense.  Trust me…I know.  However, while money is a great gift, the endeavors come with stress. Maybe you can handle it, but maybe the dam will break.  You may incur the big bang (sadly I believe this will be to God's delight).  There is nothing a human can do.  
        
        Except there is.  To give some backstory; I always knew the answer.  Maybe we all do.  Also maybe we sometimes forget it.  I survived college (sans degree, but with my mind and soul attached) listening to Alan Watts.  I read some of his biography and it's full of religious studies.  He is truly a hero of mine, and because taking the step to read his history is another level of respect I'll let the reader decide for themselves whether they should know him or not.  However; his lectures are incredible.  For the dozens that I listened to in college it was the one I listened to last night that was Perfect.  
        
        "In all that you do, have fun".

        "Hello America!"  Get me a couch.   There was only one thing I loved to do late night, and this time I don't mean masturbate.  I don't mean late night television either.  It was either FOX or Nickelodean but every night I spent an hour with America's favorite not-a-father.  

It shouldn't be a secret that I loved my father.  It should also be no secret that we had a ton of issues.  For all the times he expected me to be a perfect son, I excused his shortcomings as a father.  It was an easy thing to do in America.  There were father figures all over the place.  Rap and television was a place to find some, but also local store owners were always eager to share a word or two-many.  I looked up to a lot of people, but none made it to the level of "Daddy" that my father had, except one…Bernie Mac.  
	
I'm a comedian at heart.  I may have developed into a dramatic actor, but it was comedy that got me there.  Always one to believe there was a time and place for everything- I was the class clown in the lunch room.  It was a habit that made middle school bearable when I became the clowned object.  I had discovered enough of myself by then to survive but I carried the scars.  I knew I wanted to be a man.  I knew I always wanted to be a boy. 

Fathers are important in this task, but any boy will tell you they are not enough.  Fathers are a symbol of authority, my backside will confirm that.  I frequently found myself afraid to share my thoughts with my dad.  I wanted to avoid a verbal attack or even worse a speech.  My friends (the best) filled in the space, but they were as inexperienced as I was and in the same position.  I was looking for someone to look up to.  

I probably caught the tail end of the Bernie Mac show, and then I fell in love with the non-stop reruns.  I wanted to be a man-  first I had to know what that was.  Respectfully, my dad instilled too much fear for me to see him as one.  My goal wasn't to make everyone terrified with a "my way or the highway" attitude.  I wanted to get the girl and roll with the bros.  Bernie Mac gave me a bonus.  I carry my father's authoritarian air, but smoothed by the Mac daddy.  He taught me how to laugh and when to punch.  My swagger, that carries a lot of my father, has a bit of a swing from the Mac.  Bernie Mac taught me how to be sweet.  It was a lacking feature of my father.  It's what forced me to the highway route.  It's better to catch flies with honey, is the saying, and when you're an immigrant it's quite important.  

Sweetness is something that is becoming increasingly rare in the world, and I'm happy I was able to get a little taste of it.  Thank you, Bernie Mac.  Thank you, Daddy.

        I love movies.   The magic behind a good production always takes my breath away. In the movies you have actors, directors, gaffers and a million technical aspects.  You also have a script.  A good script is what gets the machine rolling.  It's great that all a writer needs is a pen and paper and maybe, just maybe, something beautiful will come from it. 
        Min Jin Lee is a writers and she sat down and decided to pen, Free Food for Millionaires.  
            
        I was attracted to the title.  I learned in college that the title of a script or play is not to be ignored.  It is something to be processed along with the rest of the text.  From the title I imagined a buffet of expensive ducks, turkeys, legumes…the works and sharp toothed folks stabbing for whatever they can grab.  I couldn't be more wrong.  Free Food for Millionaires presented a down to earth story that was shockingly compassionate.  
        
        We have Casey. The story centers around her relationships- her family, friends, and work.  She is the wild child in her family.  I admired that about her very much.  Unlike her sister she didn't blindly follow the directions of her parents, specifically her father.  She went to college, but she seems intent on making her own mistakes and discovering her own path.  I find that her college experience anchors her present life.  Though she recently graduated, she is unemployed and her ivy league memories and experiences hurt and help her.  Casey plays catch-up.  She played it in college against children with much bigger bank accounts than her and it shows in her current lifestyle of being $20,000 in credit card debt, but buying thousand dollar clothes and $100 food deliveries on a whim.  It drove me crazy, but much of it fuels her lifestyle.  She is a designer at heart.  She works at a small fashion boutique on the side and has a love and skill for hat making, but this isn't reflected in her college major or her job opportunities. 
        
        Finding that her boutique job cannot make ends meet she gets a job in the financial sector.  This piqued my interest, because along with the hungry millionaires, I also expected a million tips and tricks on how to get there and be there safely.  Her reasoning to join the financial sector was clear. I never considered it, but if what you need is money, Finance is the way to go.  However it's a very difficult job and she has to go back to school while still working to support herself (add more work because she has to intern).  Financially it starts to work out well, and I admire Casey's ability to juggle the responsibilities of her personal life, but her work life is so demanding I was left wondering if it was truly worth it.  I guess it's a young thing.  At the start I'll say she's 24, and by the end I'll say she's 32 years of age.  
        
        At 24 she was dating and living with her boyfriend.  Culture is signaled throughout the book because she is Korean, and her boyfriend (at the time) was White American.  Her boyfriend Jay made good money in finance, and he was a wolf by all accounts.  He believed in status and he was moving through the ranks well.  His mistake was letting Casey walk in on him having a treat(2).  Her backbone stood tall and she left him. She missed him, but she never went back.  
        
        Throughout that tumultuous time Casey confided in her friends.  Ella was a sweet and well natured girl with a very good background.  There's a naivete to a girl like her.  Her father was a doctor and her mother died during childbirth.  However she worked some in her youth.  It was clear she didn't have to.  Ella married a very successful financier named Ted.  Please make special note that though Ella didn't have to work she chose to in her youth, because sadly it didn't influence her marriage.  I don't think it's something Ted weighed.  Ted was a shark.  He grew up rough and knew to get his hands dirty.  This is a detail he kept hidden from the perfect well raised culture of his wife.  Instead he decided to spark a romance with another shark.  Delia was more comfortable and familiar to him, but she came with her own baggage.  Although she was the sexiest thing on the block in any direction she couldn't have kids.  Ted was more focused on having the thing that everyone coveted the most, but loved her enough to reach for the child he had with Ella.  The savior was Ted's mother.  She refused to even look at her son after the treatment he doled out to his wife.  He eventually backed down, and Ella sought employment at the place of her youth rekindling a lost love in the process.
        
        Casey's other friend, for they were few, was Virginia.  Their relationship was generally restricted to being pen pals.  Virginia was an art dealer and a magnet for the wealthy elite.  She spent much of her time traveling abroad with more than enough capital to support the lifestyle.  I admired the relationship.  Throughout the book there was an attitude that Casey and her family were less than or poor because they owned a dry cleaning service.  It killed me to read those sections of text.  Casey's father and mother were two hard working people who managed to get two kids through college.  I'm 30 now, and I understand my own upbringing enough to understand the amount of attention these parents pumped into their children.  Virginia's ability to stand beside Casey can only be considered brave.  It's one of the toughest lessons of my 20's.  
        
        I've spoken about Casey's work and friends.  I must applaud the author again and excuse my considering Casey the anchor of the story.  Min Lee does an amazing job of diving the reader into the psyches of every character.  Through her parents we have a great backstory of her father's path to America, but her mother's experience is truly exceptional.  Much of the community revolves around church.  Even Casey with her wild heart makes it to church every Sunday.  Through the church we discover her mother has a gift.  She is an amazing singer and the new chorus director takes note.  Leah, being a married woman, in no way returns the advances, but she acknowledges an attraction.  The attraction comes to a head in the back set of a car, and ends with a miscarriage.  I'm not a psychologist or psychiatrist or in any way allowed to comment on this experience outside of intuition, but I'm going to- intuitively.
        
        First Leah said no.  As an artist I understand the push of the choral director.  When you're good at something everyone wants a piece of you.  You get accustomed to yes, and even get penalized for saying no.  There's a bit of conditioning there that makes no sense.  Still as artists we have to be sensitive.  It's our responsibility.  Secondly, I believe the director was attracted to Leah's voice.  The same effect that the coral director has on dozens of women is the same effect Leah had on him.  His actions were inexcusable, irresponsible and could have cost her her life if not her marriage.  Her husband has his tubes tied. 
        
        Casey's work life requires special examination.  Casey is one of the guys.  She fits in, in a way few women can.  She is my favorite type of woman, a tomboy; however there are three boys who catch her attention.  Hugh, the successful playboy type, operates as a kind of fling.  I almost expected her to end up with him; maybe he did also- he extended the invite but it's not his nature nor is it hers to accept being the second fiddle just for a place to sleep. We saw this with Jay.  Then there is Unu.  From Casey's perspective the cousin of her friend Ella is dead in the water.  He spent his time with her both unemployed and neither looking for work.   His personal belongings were steadily exchanged to cover gambling debts, and eventually he lost his apartment (a thematic object).  Casey actually succumbed to the tough advances of Hugh while with Unu, and was kicked out before he hit rock bottom, but Unu's details are a little spectacular.  He wasn't any better at trading than gambling (and the man made money/stopping, I think, was the issue).  For Unu it seemed that he could get a job anytime and anywhere, but his conscience wouldn't let him.  He found it better to gamble with his own wealth than to share his losses with a pension fund.  It's not something he ever shared with Casey, his guilt.  If he had maybe Casey's unhappiness with her work choices could have come to light sooner.  The last page of the book they share together, both understanding that Casey will likely refuse the permanent position of her internship. Finally, there is Sabine, the owner of the boutique shop Casey works at.  Sabine is a self made millionaire and it's clear she is looking for an heir.  Her and her equally wealthy husband do not have children of their own, but Sabine is actually looking for an heir to her dynasty and Casey is clearly the number one choice.  Casey is aware of her privilege, but she fights against it.  I don't hate her fighting it.  Sabine is too used to having her way and can turn anyone into a zombie-like follower.  However, to Casey's money issues and what I believe to be her true love- she is a milliner at heart.  I bet she would love to do it for money, but how on earth could she make money at it!..how…How for Christ's Sake!  If only she worked at a hat shop, and had a millionaire in her pocket.  
        
        P.S.  Kindness goes a long way.  As does following your heart.  Casey was a heavy reader…I believe she was a lit major for undergrad, and she liked to read the same books over and over.  She rode the bus frequently and another passenger spotted this detail along with her many lovely hats.  It turns out his wife had the same habit, but she died years before and he kept those hats in the attic of his old home.  Being the voracious reader she is- Casey gravitates toward a book shop- his bookshop, and they spark a friendship.  Now rather than look from afar Casey sits next to him on their shared commute to work.  Eventually the man dies, but Casey receives an invite to the funeral.  She decides to go (I told you her commitment to her personal life was something to admire) and finds out that dozens if not hundreds of hats were left to her.  
        
        The end.
        
        It wasn't a movie after all.  Free Food for Millionaires was a small novel, but with the detail involved in every character's life- it would make a great one.

        There’s a youtube video posted by “someone”, but it should be Mark Zuckerburg himself talking about the future of social media.  I haven’t watched it yet, but it’s saved and I’m hoping it's about something separate from his business ventures.  I was happy to run into a video like that because, “social media” isn’t something that I’ve been able to get away from.  I’ve run into things like, “Your company doesn’t exist unless you have social media” to the more extravagant “You don’t exist unless you have social media”.  Within my typical INTJ mind I have a hard time swaying left or right.  I can’t and won’t say if it’s right or wrong that social media has penetrated so deep into our lifestyles, because there are too many benefits.  However; there are misuses and abuses.
	
I was late to the cell phone game, but I may have been surprisingly early to the computer game.  I remember browsing through the Myspace chat room and running into a new Iphone owner’s mad raves about his exciting new phone.  I was happy for him, and couldn’t wait to see what would come next.  “One button?  How do you text?”  It was easy enough for me to stay connected using a computer, but it wasn’t until college that I got my own cell phone.  Before then I survived on an Ipod touch with a hotspot router.  Those were the good days.  I want to call them the transition days, but the apps store was well developed and there was no shortage of good games to play and apps to reach out to friends with.  

Myspace sadly didn’t make it past the transition.  I remember saying goodbye as I sat in a library making my first facebook account.  I had to be cajoled into it.  Since then Facebook has become the mammoth it is now.  I don’t only use it to post and check on friends; it’s also my password for a bunch of different websites.  To be honest, I don’t even know how that works.  It’s not my primary source of news…but I get a lot of info from there.  Too much info.  In a way it does things that I never expected it to do.  Somewhere in my relationship with Facebook I got freaked and ended my account.  The TMI became too much, but it exposed me to a different world.  

Dark ads is a term used when you're browsing online and are clickbaited, or run across a message built to trigger.  These days I often think about that first Iphone user.  There was genuine excitement, and he was one of the first to have the product.  My happiness for him was genuine.  10 years later I wonder if he still has that excitement.  During that transition period I remember playing games like Trenches and COD Zombies.  For the latter I played online with friends.  Like finding new music there was always talk about some new app; in college I managed to turn a friend onto Fun Run.  It was a cool feeling, but Fun Run was a new kind of game.  During the transition I remember an aviation game that made it seem like I was flying a mach1 fighter jet.  It felt like I was having an experience, because I was learning something.  Fun Run wasn’t the worst of it, but it was a game I could spend hours playing and get nothing out of.  The worst of it were games I knew to stay away from, I don’t remember their names.  It’s not all bad.  Sometimes there is time to kill…sometimes.

The transition period was rampant with pictures of pets, faces, and food, and over time content creators became a profession.  Parents and older gens all over the world go “DAFUQ is that”.  It’s strange to explain because we had a similar discussion a few years ago with NFT’s.  Some content creators in my opinion are true artists and create something unique and true to themselves.  Others copy and paste, but still get a million hits and a paycheck.  With NFT’s the argument is why pay for that if I can just copy it and enjoy it that way.  Well, ownership is key here.  Copy and paste isn’t bad.  For example there are readings of open sourced books that I can listen to on youtube.  I wouldn’t call it “art”, but it’s a viable product.  Then there are accounts that create compilations of videos…you know those vids when you see them…are they considered art?  

I honestly don’t know.  Someone probably took the time to compile these vids for our entertainment.  I ran into a comment section where the page creator was defending his work saying “people send in these vids and I have permission to post them”, but I want to single these works out for a reason.  The internet is complicated and advanced and ever expanding.  In the last two years face swapping and voice modification and many other softwares have taken over.  I love it…I’m an artist.  However there is a level of fakeness that would impress even Hollywood.  I can’t pick left or right on social media, because there is no left or right on the internet.  It’s a bit of a free for all, and I’m wary of any kind of control.  

There is a solution and Hollywood has shown it plenty of times.  I don’t think any industry is as prepared for the negative side of the internet as Hollywood.  We’ve seen it in the Matrix, and recently I’ve seen it in Johnny Mnemonic (both Keany Reeves films surprisingly).  As the world moves away from industry and becomes more information, Hollywood always depicts it as some dystopian nightmare.  You're either awake or asleep, and if you're awake you’re privy to messed up shit.  However; if I let Hollywood lead again, there is still something to fight for.  I don’t know if it’s beneficial to think otherwise.  The luscious green environment 90’s Hercules and Xena was set in gave way to the brick and mortar of the Bad Boys trilogy.  That brick and mortar is giving way to a codex and as long as it’s made of quality material I’m game.   This means putting heart into actions, and producing what moves.

        Today I'd like to step outside of myself and speak on women.  It's a subject I promise not to touch very often, but I allowed myself permission because the topic is on their success.  Success is selling or having sold, and I am a connoisseur of a few things feminine.  

Success is relative.  It's a complicated term that covers "One man's trash is another man's treasure", and "Don't throw the baby out with the bath water".  This means that just because you lost your first choice, don't just give up.  Success comes after much toil, and sometimes you'll have to settle for "gettin it". It's not a cheap title to have.  Success is quite expensive and it comes with a price.  

As a salesman there is one thing I understand more than anything else- sex sells.  Sex appeal is one of sales' greatest selling points.  Ask Steve Jobs; his iPhone was designed with sleek and sexy in mind.  Unfortunately the iPhone isn't directly responsible for sexual production so Steve's design objectives pale in comparison to the design objectives of a woman.  

I did not stutter or misspeak.  I did say "the design objective of a woman", but I mean objectives that increase pay, assist in mating, and increase a woman's overall happiness.  I'd love to remove the man from the equation, but that's impossible.  The male gaze should provide direction to the female: These are the tits men like.  This is the butt men like.  This never eliminates the female  gaze which like the male gaze is always slightly inward.  It shouldn't eliminate a woman's happiness or self worth.  I'm not sure if women have noticed, but the bigger the better.  

We've hit dysmorphia.  The opportunities of plastic surgery are not the blame.  Corsets and thousands of generations of physical preferences are the real culprits.  However; plastic surgery is still unique.  Women have the opportunity to permanently tweak any part of the body they would like.  I'll never understand rhinoplasty.  I'll stick to ass and tits- a woman can have a bigger ass or double d's in a matter of hours.  Can I remind the readers that the bigger the better(…I mean have you swam in titties?  It's gorgeous.)  The opportunities provided by plastic surgery are medical marvels, but maybe Plain Jane needs some love.  

Nicky Minaj is a rapper in the States.  She's phenomenal.  And gorgeous. Beautiful.  I ran across an interview where she talked about being in the room with other musicians (rappers) and listening to them talk about "bad bitches".  Bad bitches have that bigly that men like: phat asses, big tits, curves, and face. (I'd just like to share that with the proper ass you can avoid all holes and squeeze them cheeks together…tasty…maybe take a lil dip) HOWEVER; Minaj had to overhear that as a developing artist.  Her energy shouts "one of the boys", but she's still a girl.  That's that first thing that stood out to me.  Then I found out about her plastic surgery.  She felt like she had to do it to succeed in the industry. 

I'm curious.  This is a question from the boys, does Jane hit the Squat? Or is that only after the BBL?  

I'm not sticking up for Jane here, and I'm not slamming the BBL.  A natural body is a well honed body.  That's the gym.  That's squatting and cardio.  That's Jane on a Friday night ready to sweat everything out.  It's also plastic surgery, both for reasons necessary and frivolous.  Brainstorming this topic I realized that toning is not enough.  Go all the way.  The aim should be to be well honed.  That's body, mind, and soul conditioning.  Why have a perfect body, but bad teeth, or a cancer? Plastic surgery is a gift, but as a man I know I hate the idea of razors near my wee wee.  Maybe I could get myself a real weapon huh- increase my girth, but I'm not eager to modify.  It takes a lot to make a man alter himself.  Women are more open to it, but I do wish that wasn't the case.  Sex sells.  Def Loaf is one of my favorite female rappers.  Her first album, my favorite, has her naked on the cover.  I'd love a naked Dej anytime- except on her first album.  Her rhymes were love and sex and rough streets.  The album was a tough one.  While very sexy- she was still encased and safe.  Her heart wasn't even out like that, so why were her tits? 

I recently posted a video where Mythbusters checked to see if having bigger tits led to greater tips.  Yes it did, but also the smile on mom's face to wear a fake pair.  I might not have noticed it, if it wasn't for the lead actress from Shameless starring in a movie- one where she wore fake breasts.  She described it as scary and liberating.  What is it about bigly things?  If women are following the male gaze, allow me to apologize.  Oh yes thunder thighs (thighs work well too btw), but yes also to the slender and slim.  Yes to 10 hours of work and big Mac and a burp.  Yes to a lil make up before the drive home.  Yes to Nicky (and Nicky on onlyFans) and yes to the cashier or bank teller or nurse.  

Hone and tone ladies.  There's many a gaze.  
It may seem like success is sex, but it's only that sex sells.  It is a quality as much as an act, and the biggest sex organ is…you know where.

        Color is a tough topic in America.  Color is caked in generations of oppression.  Red, black, white and others their hues are mixed with violence, oppression and slavery.  In this way color is used to identity.  It is an easy way to tell above from below.  I am below.  It doesn't end my story.  Neither does the story of colors start at identifying.

        The world is moving in a unique direction.  Sure, there’s a lot of the same old same old happening (the war in Ukraine, hunger and poverty, coronavirus’), but somewhere away from the prying eyes of the five o’ clock news there are gamers huddled around their consoles testing out the latest and greatest in video game software.  I’m a mid level gamer.  I enjoy the time consuming task enough to dedicate a few hours a day to it, but not enough to have a console for my console.  Video game setup’s can get intense and competitive.  There’s even money to make from the consumer side of things.

        I grew up on the sands of Miami Beach.  I went there after school, after work, after anything.  It was home away from home, and became my refuge when home offered none.  I befriended sea shells, and conchs in private nooks beneath piers.  There could have been no better summer.

            Authority is a drab subject.  There's something about people who delegate orders- they cast a dark shadow.  It's tough to process an alcohol party or smoking session with an authority figure.  Tomorrow; you'll have to find some way to impress them…your livelihood depends on it.  At workplace functions we're saved by the law of live and let live. By tomorrow the last 8 hours will be carefully swept beneath a rug and checked on only in predetermined and thoroughly premeditated times.  It works well for office workers.  The same law affects warehouse workers, as infrequent as their cookouts are, and almost every working environment in the world.  The working environment, the minefield it is, is quite safe.

        The United States public school system is one of the finest in the world.  Possibly it could take a hint from the catholic school system and provide a bit of negative reinforcement, but the policy I was raised on mimics the online courses of today- you get what you put in.  Since I am a product of such a system there are things that the system itself expects of me.  I’m expected to know how to read and write (type and hand written).  I’m expected to be proficient in math.  The basics aren’t enough apparently.  They threw in geometry, pre-algebra, statistics, and even pre-calculus.  I’m expected to have knowledge of American history and I’ll say I should be able to bumble my way through world history as well (the world is pretty big after all).  The system expects me to know the major differences between the elements we studied in science- which like math is pretty broad.  There’s chemistry, biology, and my favorite, the easy A, earth science.   As students we are even expected to have favorites.  They call them electives, I call

        Have I discovered the police?  Before I blog I like to do research.  Reading over my notes on the topic there is a section that says “this is useless”.   Well, I like to do the research only if it’s necessary, and the reason why I considered it useless is that the real issue seemed buried beneath bureaucracy and split second decisions.  The Area Code 911 blogs are research blogs; therefore,  I put in work.  I researched the topic generally, but overall the point of the blog was to take the reader along as I redefine my definition of what a police officer is.

        So I’ve been wanting to comment on Gordan Geiko since I watched the second part and then the original a few weeks ago.  

        Because this is a new medium I should introduce it.  I don’t want to call it a blog.  I’d say it’s a lot more personal than that.  This (I’ll call it a platform) is for me to share my thoughts.  It's simple enough...I’m a pen and paper guy, but in this context we’re talking keyboard and mouse. So with no further delay...WELCOME TO Thoughts By Ian Fermy. 
            
        SO back to Geiko  (and remember this is FERMY’s BRAIN so don’t look for direct linear progression of topics...if you can help it).   Geiko stood out to me as the antagonist.  The evil person in the story the hero sets out to beat.  Which is funny because the hero in both the stories sought Geiko out first.  They sought him out not to defeat him, but to learn from him.  Why?  Because he was winning.  Or maybe in Shia’s place he was a winner...That of course is the stress of his relationship with Gordan’s daughter.  If Shia’s character really cared about her he would have stayed away from her father.  
        
        Gordon Geiko personifies the man who wants to win above all.  Gordon is destructive.  Me being the uber introspective viewer that I am- I couldn’t help but take investing advice from Gordan.  And I couldn’t help but notice the monster behind his practice.  I could never be a Gordan Geiko, I decided. 
        
        Gordon is punished with betrayal and then imprisonment.    Gordon Geiko, The Destroyer, was taken down in the 80’s only to return to his ways upon release.  This time his prey was his son in law with his daughter as collateral. Geiko only knows how to win.  I cannot blame him.  I rebuke him.  But what of those who sought his praise.  Geiko (the man and his daughter) knows what he is and what he is capable of.  It’s how the man eats.  I cannot say the same for the characters of Charlie Sheen and Shia Lebouef.  
        
        When it comes to Wall Street and Money Never Sleeps I disagree that the story is about a power hungry executive and those bent on taking him down.  I say it is overall a story about the challenges of Altruism.  Charlie Sheen’s character showed loyalty to his father and Shia Lebeouf’s never let go of his girlfriend's hand even as he went into business with her father against her wishes.  Meanwhile; Gordon Geiko showed loyalty to one man, Gordan Geiko.  
        
        Sheen's character hunted down Gordan Geiko.  I’m sure those scenes taught me how to get a job, and led to me writing this.  After a test Sheen is in.  His task is to collect information.  That’s not what he does at his day job right? At his day job he’s moving numbers and living in the City, I believe.  By all accounts he is doing well (there was already a biddy in his bed)- even with a necessary loan from his pops.  But Sheen’s character wants more.  If he’s not in the City that’s where he needs to be, and he needs square footage to flex.  His thirst and his drive attract him to Gordan Geiko like honey.  He can smell the success.  Does he understand Geiko’s business practice after a couple “tag-a-longs” (Geiko sends Sheen to spy on a business associate, maybe a few).  The scope of Sheen's use is a spy who is paid handsomely.  Should a spy divulge personal information?  Sheens character (either out of a desire to impress Geiko or to get rich.  I hope it's the latter) imparts personal information through his spy channel...to benefit.  That decision blows up in his face when Geiko destroys to collect his massive check… again it’s how he eats.  The damage  was to his fathers company, and Sheen rushed to the rescue.  Sheen shows his ability, HIS OWN ABILITY, to drive down stock and force a sell and a buy.  For the first time I saw Sheen’s character get rich.  Even with the million from Geiko he was never richer.  
        
        Sheen’s character succumbed to the altruism trap.  The trap has nothing to do with Geiko.  It’s the trap of believing your own bullshit.  Sheen wanted to get rich.  He was out there sniffing ass on Gordan’s orders, but he was always the man at the desk making phone calls. *Note his raise to office from cubicle.  Literally. It was his day job.   He was always the man we saw at the beginning of the movie.  After getting in with Gordan Geiko why do you hang on to your day job?  Is there doubt behind a million dollar pay day?  Sheen’s character wanted to be safe.  He hung on to his day job because he never fully gave in to Geiko.  That’s his fault.  He sought Geiko, and Geiko showed interest.  Geiko’s only interest after the dealings with his fathers company was to tell Sheen to take the money and go home because that’s what Geiko would do.  
        
        The altruism in Money Never Sleeps comes from Shia’s love of his fiance.  Shia was for sure concerned with her happiness, but he fell into the boyfriend trap.  He thought he was making a decision that was good for both of them- even though he ignored her warnings. Witnessing Geiko’s actions in the first movie I was even more distraught with those in the second.  My only perspective is he saw the money as his.  His daughter never used it, and his deal with Shia was to get his hands on it.  Instead of completing the transaction with Shia he rebuilt everything he’s lost.  Obviously stealing the money, crashing Shia’s plans, and subsequently leaving a company on the brink of collapse. Let's say that impacts 1000 lives.  Of that 1000 1 is on top and the other 999 are no happier than Shia visiting his pregnant fiance.  
        
        As a note Sheen’s character made an appearance in Money Never Sleeps to say hey I’m still where you found me.  That’s not all bad.  He had no business sniffing asses.  Some of us are not made Geiko’s.  
        
        So the characters that I discovered watching The Wall Streets are: a disgruntled employee, a proud boy, and two Gorden Geiko’s.   The male Geiko showing actual progression when he does something out of character by returning the stolen check, saving those 1000 lives.  I leave this article agreeing that Geiko is not the hero, but doubting if he should be the antagonist.  I wonder if the antagonist could be found closer to the disgruntled employee and the proud boy.  They may find their actual fight in their reluctance to fully commit.
        
        Of course I have to mention that Geiko can very well be considered the hero if both movies are taken into consideration as the one who undergoes the most change is in fact Geiko.
