    <h2>The Greatest Movies</h2>

    <div class="27dresses">
        <img src="img/movies/update713/27dresses.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">I'm not the type to get married, but...so the story goes.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/3000milestograceland.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">Vegas, Elvis, and guns. Need I say more.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/americangangster.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">I have to say there aren't enough black action movie stars.  Denzel is so intense that even though he is one (and this movie is proof) it's always a drama.  Long Live the King.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/americanpie.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">Young, Dumb, and Stupid.  Probably not broke though.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/antoinefisher.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">This is Denzel in drama. But it's weird, the man is so good at picking work that even the tempo in this moves like an action movie. This is a favorite because it's an example of what a positive influence can mean in a world of pain. </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/apocaliptico.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">Mel Gibson directed this.  I saw this within 4 years after 2012.  Mel was being dragged in the media.  And there was the hype around Passion of the Christ a few years earlier.  After watching this I've become an even bigger Mel Gibson fan.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/arrow.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">I'm not a big superhero movie fan.  But Arrow was good.  There are superpowers, but I love DC's habit of rooting them in science and technology.  Even better Arrow factors in skill as well- not to mention the psycotic factor usually present in Batman.  Green Arrow is not as dark and brooding as Batman.  He's more the playboy, and the show is really fun.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/atonement.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">Girl's got jokes.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/augustrush.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">Not a musical, but a film with music.   I love these.  It's its own genre, but I see so few of them.  Watch this movie to let them know to make more.</p>  
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/awalkintheclouds.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">It's strange living is an environment where the words "Death of a Salesman" is more than a play.  It feels like selling was outsourced to some specific industry.  But growing up this made me want to be a travelling salesman.  Dude just walks around selling chocolate and fallingin love.  well there's an idea.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/badboys.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">The classic.  Martin Lawrence and Will Smith both made nanms for themselves in the action genre, but like Washington it still comes off as comedy.  I've seen these movies at least 3 times.  It was the third time that I realized the two characters are not playing.  This is not a comedy.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/bandofbrothers.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">Had to watch these movies for scene study class in college.  Until that point I was a big war movie fan.  This knocked the taste right out of my mouth.  The play was All My Sons</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713//beverlyhillsninja.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">It's a shitty world when comedy genius' like Chris Farley commit suicide.  Do yourself a favor and enjoy this film.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/bigtimerush.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">Nick...I don't kow what to say.  Big Time Rush was a blast.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/blacksnakemoan.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">I expected horror.  Nothing, I mean nothing, could have prepared me for Christina Ricci in this.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/bourneidentity.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">Matt Damon was the best person for these movies. I say that because he doesn't come off as a movie star. He looks and acts like he just got off a shift at the coffee shop.  I think those people make the best peformers, and it was a joy watching Matt work.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/campnowhere.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">What's strange about the world today is that the kids have no concept of life without their parents.  I have to tell them, "Once upon a time, Camp Nowhere existed".</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/charliestcloud.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">I never watched High School Musical, but I couldn't dodge the hype.  I knew of Zach Efron, but I became a fan after this movie.  It's nothing spectular, and maybe a little too sad, but 1) something's got to happen and 2) I love movies about life.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/chronicle.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">High school moves have lost a lot of support apparently.  I hardly see movies with kids in high school.  Chronicle was unique because the kids developed super powers and then had to deal with them...sounds like puperty doesn't it.  </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/cityofgod.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">This has got to be the king of slum god movies.  While watching movies it's important to understand that "something has to happen", so what I think is awesome is not the violence surrounding the kids, but the kids living their lives inside of that.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/courageunderfire.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">A classic.  Life is hard.  And sometimes winners are actually losers.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/cradletothegrave.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">There's nothign cooler than watching DMX flex his acting chops.  He's got a few movies to his name, and I'm pretty sure he's an action movie star.  And there are few, so it's a big deal.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/crazybeautiful.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">We fight for something.  Rich or poor, we fight, and it's not easy.</p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/deadsilence.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">I'm the type to laugh during a horror movie.  Not this one.  I learned to fear the doll after watching this.</p>
    </div>

    <div>

        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">What would you do if you found a pile fo gold in a cabin inthe woods?</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/deathrace.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">Need for speed, live action.  No offense to the actual Need for Speed movie, but if you've played the game, that's prettty much was this was.  Or maybe it was Burnout.  Whatever it was it was like Mario Kart mixed with Fast and Furious.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/dejaview.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">So action packed, but the story is well developed that I cannot tell if this is a drama or an action flick.  I think these are called thrillers.  And the thrill was on.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/devilsadvocate.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">Do you have it all, or does it have you?  I'm a businessman and I like to risk it all, but if there was ever something that taught me to chill out, it's this.</p>

        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">Don't Be a Menance in South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood.  That's the full title, and like the title there's so much more to the movie.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/eagleeye.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">You know I think about my phone using a bottle of water to easedrop on me all the time.  Hello NSA!</p>

        <img src="img/movies/update713/eightcrazynights.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">A cartoon, for adults- without the sex.  Really great option for a sleepless night.  Even in his vocal pattern Adam Sandler has a way of making life's shittyness positive.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/exmachina.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">If there was a movie that predicted the future- it's this one.  Not just the AI, but the entire environment. </p>

        <img src="img/movies/update713/fourrooms.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">This movie is a favorite not only because of the great story telling, but it's an example of the magic of a the camera when its set in a specific environment. </p>>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/friday13th.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">This is a classic.  But beside that it's funny how much they don't say.  Kreugger is cool because it's always a puzzle to unravel his actions.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/funnygames.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">I think this triggered the rise in home invasion movies.  It's really the coolest genre because they started playing around with disabilities like deafness and loss of sight.  When someone breaks into your  home, and you're blind as a bat...but this started it all.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/funwithdickandjane.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">This flick came out during the crash of 08.  During those times anyone would have done anything for money.  During those times, more than any other, the people needed a remainder that money isn't everything.</p>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/grandmagotrunoverbyareindeer.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">A complete classic.  I'm not even sure America exists without this movie. It's a shame people forget.</p>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/harlemnights.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">This flick is Eddie Murphy at his best.  This is before the family movies.  And while there was nothing wrong with those, sometimes you want to see Eddie rock a tight red leather suit.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/headhunters.jpg">

        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">This is a throw back from when I was really young.  It's really my first exposure to Sherlock Holmes, and it was set in the future.</p>

        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">This was a massive bonus to hip hop culture.  The hip hop movies kind of died out after 8mile.  It came back with Hustle and Flow.</p>

        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">The Justice League from the early 2000's was super real.  I was used to cartoons being "social", but I wasn't used to the political nature of them. There were some big issues tackled in Justice League and Justice League Unlimited.</p>
    </div>

    <div>

        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">My dude did everything from behind a jail cell.  This movie has so many layers.  The first layer asks who benefits from justice.</p>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/legandoftheseeker.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">I love a good sword flick.  There was Beastmaster, Xena, Hercules then the genra kind of died for a few years on television. It came back with Legand of the Seeker. The only difference is that Xena and that lot kind of lived the life traveling from adventure to adventure, the Seeker was on a mission. It kind of shows the mindset of the generations where one was not really up to much but found trouble, and the other set out with a goal in mind (a prophesy).  It's interesting to think about.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/movies/update713/lostanddelirious.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">This was one of the tv movies on a Saturday afternoon. It's like finding a gem on Netflix.  Plus lesbians. </p>

        <img src="img/movies/update713/manonfire.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">You see Denzel, the gun, the explosion, and still if you watch this movie you would probably agree that it's a drama.  I think action films treat human interaction as a gimmick.  Like someone is going to die- the director knows it/ the audience knows it.  Getting the audience to care is like a bonus or something.  But someone on Denzels team is all about picking material that goes beyond the fight scenes.  There's a story in a story in a story in this one.</p>
    </div>

        <img src="img/movies/update713/maximumexposure.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">Before Wild n Out, before FailArmy, there was Maximum Exposure.  I didn't have cable for my first ten years in the States, so even though it was on the tele Maximum Exposure was before Punk'd.</p>

        <img src="img/movies/update713/meetthespartans.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">300 should be on the list.  It's not because I mix my love for 300 with this movie.  This is everything a parody should be. You probably shouldn't parody too many war movies, but 300 walked into this one.</p>

        <img src="img/movies/update713/minorityreport.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">I almost forgot about this one.  I was super into science fiction when I was a kid.  Today I fancy myself a scientist...so fancy that.  This movie is special because plot and moral wise they predicted the direction of technology and as an audience member you have to think about the advantages and disadvantages of using advanced technology for crime deterance.</p>

        <img src="img/movies/update713/mrbrooks.jpg">
        <p style="width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">I've been falling in love with Kevin Costner the last few years.

        <p style=" width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">Right...this one was great because I'd revently move to Vegas and was all alone in the hotel room with the controller.  Some things about the environment- the pool out front, the hookers in the magazines- made the vibe perfect </p>

        <img src="img/movies/skins.jpg">
        <p style=" width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">The real kicker for Skins were the three mini movies they did maybe two years after the series ended.  I was in college, but nearing the end, and I couldn't help but wonder what life would be like. heh (timing was great because I actually watched the Series first year.)</p>

        <img src="img/movies/thebreakfastclub.jpg">
        <p style=" width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">This made it onto the list during its stint on Netflix.  Nothing like scrolling and stumbling across a gem. The story was great, but the time spent scrolling past it made it more cathartic.</p>

        <p style=" width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">There is a thing about movies from this era.  There was no CGI.  Apart from direction they relied on good writing.  Not only storytelling, but character development as well.  My heart fell out of my chest at the end.  My little 10 year old heart.</p>

    <div class="" style="margin-top: 5px">
        <img src="img/movies/theruins.jpg">
        <p style=" width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">This one was a good time.  Another traveler movie-  I've been a traveler since a young age so I pay extra attention to things- like the human organ trade in the movie. Also respect the environment.</p>

        <p style=" width: 250px; position: relative; left: 42%;">Sometimes there are movies that I watched growing up, and I don't remember the story the characters, but I never forget it.

            <p>A trilogy and then a prequel.  The ending was beautiful.  It's funny if I think about it, most cultures have their own idea of "magic".  Stroud was a brit I think and it's lovely to see a magical world separate from Harry Potter.</p>

            <p>This is Body rides by Richard Laymon.  A wonderful piece pf text.  I hung out in the adult section a lot and I ran into this one.  It wasn't easy. Libraries don't have a "porn" section, but every now and then I found a gem.The sex is the least exciting part. </p>

            <p>The City of Ember became a movie and it's star is my favorite indy actress.  I'm not going to butcher her name.  There may be a story here.  I starting reading after breaking my arm in the third grade.  I had to go to the library instead of PE.  It took me a while to actually crack open a book, and it's very possible that this was that book. </p>

            <p>I have a blog on this one.  Get to it <a href="boublogupdate.html">here.</a>To say a bit more I was attracted by the title.  I thought it would be an educational read, but from the perspective of greed.  That couldn't be further from the truth.</p>
