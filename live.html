            <p>It's coming...like comment share, so you don't miss it</p>
            <p>And we are on. I've already watched this, so it not as fresh as my last commentary. I've got pent up ideas and whatnot. Should be juicy though. The vid sure is.</p>
            <p>As always jump in and comment. These are always open.</p>
            <p>Alright right off the bat were talking about semites. I've done a bit of research on this way back in the day. In my personal world view the Middle East is a part of Africa. I can be an ass an throw in a few European countries in there as well. The reason is that so much cultural exchange happened in that region. The "look up the list" he is talking about, their area is really situated in the middle east, near the Aegean sea. That whole area (and I can be a double ass and include some of India) is African as fuck. My personal opinion, but with hella research.</p>
            <p>I don't know Griff or his hustle, but it sounds like he was being targeted with bit of career assassination.</p>
            <p>The assassination was by being accused of being an anti semite. He argued that that couldn't be him because the semites are black and he is black. Personally I'm going to switch over to African. It's a complicated subject right off the bat. Just by switching to African I've caused a rift. But I do believe that that is the argument he is making. To call Africans, black, is a little muddling to the hundreds of cultures that live on the continent (I've already included the middle east and India to complicate it further.) Black I think is the cultural name of the American Blackman. But I know within that culture, definitely in the 80's back to Africa movement, the American blackman identified with Africa as his homeland. Today uhh it's not a super popular opinion. It may not have been a "popular opinion" in the 80's either, but it was big enough to have a movement. Since Griff is sharing his story I'll say that he is one of the blacks who identifies with Africa as his homeland going so far as to claim the semetic region as is motherland.</p>
            <p>I'm going to apologize and excuse any proper uppercasing and lowercasing.</p>
            <p>Homie said it twice so I'm going to say it again..."There are 6 major corporations that control everything we watch and see"...Do I agree with this, yes, but to an extent. The everyday man has a lot more control over what gets produced. There may be a bit of a game being played behind the scenes but there's a lot more freedom than 20 years ago when I would have agreed with that statement 100 percent.</p>
            <p>The 6 people is a little too simple. These are multilevel organizations operated by hundreds of people who are constantly revolving. One thing I know, corporate America is cutthroat. Respect the game.</p>
            <p> a shitty meme that revolved a few years ago, but it was something along the lines that unless people are trying to kill you you're not doing enough. This is about the section where Nick talks about conversations that can get you in trouble.</p>
            <p>It's always the people closest to you.</p>
            <p>I feel it. It's a fine line to walk. "Walk the line" I think is the saying. I never really thought about it. They talked about how they started off getting 1000 a night (mind you the money was different) to artists today who can get paid 25000 a night, but they're on the same playing field. It's a forward moving machine. But Griff talks about how he "messed it up for everyone". He mentioned how, but it flew over my head. I grew up in an environment where everyone shared their mind and everyone made fun of everyone. Things were free that way. Griff's time was 30 years before mine but it's that forward moving machine again. Everyone looked at him like damn man...but he mentioned truth. That's the only real thing we own in this world.</p>
            <p>But in defense of the game once money is on the line everyone acts different. In Griff's defense at least he stayed true.</p>
            <p>Silencing and cointelpro was just brought up. and Farrakhan.</p>
            <p>It's what they did to Griff.</p>
            <p>Their enemies don't like rappers. I'm a DJ. I'm an artist first though and enjoy good art. Nick mentioned the propaganda machine. And I studied enough artwork to wonder why everything is so cryptic. Be it drawings or lyrics. I've attracted my own "interests" to question my youthful beliefs, but I always thought that adults got something else from songs than I did as a child. Not necessarily cryptic, but muffled. And in artworks like paintings I thought they tried to send a message that would withstand the test of time. But now I'm older and a bit more knowledgeable on the inner workings of the struggles that artists go through to get their work presented and recognized. It's a gorgeous piece of work, why was the artist shunned why what it trashed...It's a lot moire complicated that "you're too young to listen to these lyrics".</p>
            <p>Maybe there is more to the 6 corporations.</p>
            <p>But are they there to make money or to control the masses. You can't do both.</p>
            <p>Self hate is a thing...</p>
            <p>Griff is talking about claiming and ownership. I'm not trying to get into the blackman culture, and neither were Griff and Nick. But we know the game and the plays. They are looking beyond tthat.</p>
            <p>Rap in its raw. Trust me I've got plans. If recording is an issue there was a time when there were no recordings. You had to be there.</p>
            <p>On the topic on of Farrakhan and "White Devil". Opinion is a thing. I've had my opinion attacked at a very young age. Like it was stupid because I had just learned what it is. I've run into cops multiple times. One thing I cannot do is get mad when they find cause to use force. If the man says he felt threatened, then he felt threatened. Either the Law or God will decide if he was right. There is a bit of an attitude where we disregard peoples emotions and that is the only evil I can process in the world. An emotion is fact.</p>
            <p>Art and propaganda vibrate on two different levels.</p>
            <p>Propaganda has a negetive connotation but ads are propaganda. It's how you sell a product. No matter where someone is on the political spectrum...it's about selling and making money.</p>
            <p>These guys get super meta. That's why I had to make this into a discussion post. Living in a way is about getting as close to the source as possible.</p>
            <p>Everything is the most dangerous thing in America. There are certain logical fallacies that exist, and when the environment starts to look at everything as an enemy...it's time to roll out.</p>
            <p>Kanye. They brought up Kanye. I never "follow" anyone, but in a country like America I take certain cues. They said watch the throne, then Kanye followed with Yeezus. He said I am a God. If we follow Nietzsche, and we do; then we killed God. We know the Earth like the back of our hand. Kanye in my mind was the first motherfucker crazy enough to put forth the superman, and he was doing it even before "I am a God". I can do on, I won't; like I said, I never follow anyone.</p>
            <p>"We're gods having a human experience"</p>
            <p>I think you have to claim the big G. There's no fear.</p>
            <p>Divinity and saluting others. What I know is that what doesn't work will not work. Cultures tend to take over because they are doing something right. Nobody wants to die. The industrial revolution is proof of that. It may have gotten lost, but it is an individual experience. Ford left space for the next Ford. The industrial revolution stemmed from the teaching of Nietzsche and recognized the man in the machine.</p>
            <p>Griff commented that he is from the people who created civilization. There were a few cradles, but the Mesopotamian cradle practically invented math. I don...I mean it's clear how...but damn.</p>
            <p>There is a thing with recognition in the American system. I don't want to to give up hope of it, but how do you force someone to recognize..anything. Everything I have I got through strife. There was nothing but hard ass work.</p>
            <p>They're taking it there now. "The Nigga got to die" I'm not going to get into an American history lesson, but it's a mindset. It's a colorless mindset. I've been discovering that. I agree with it.</p>
            <p>With that I'll break at 21.07. To be continued.</p>
            <p>Alright back on it again, LIVE</p>
            <p>Before I start I want to go back to the Big G comment a bit. It's the magic of the I AM. It's an affirmation. Truly you can affirm anything as long as it's true to you. However, if I follow the teachings of Neville Goddard and Alan Watts the true magic of the I AM affirmation is I Am God. Taking it back to the source.</p>
            <p>I understand the Bible only as an allegorical source. As a student, even if I consider these people existing, it's the lessons behind their trails and tribulations that resonate for me. I mean its a spiritual feeding whereas to understand the lands and how power shifted I studied that from a scientific perspective.</p>
            <p>There's a level of impermeability, and that stops me from getting to lost in the topic when they start referencing the bible. I mean they start talking about differences and things...To me the epic of gilgamesh is the epic and the bible is the bible...However I will say because of the science behind it all there is a synchrony that I'm not knowledgeable enough to comment on yet.</p>
            <p>Code switching...I think the doc just referred to that difference as code switching...</p>
            <p>right...there's levels to the game, is what I want to say, but code switching is a mode of communication. It's physical and science. I think the doc refers to a level of code switching that affects someone spiritually, and that's personal. Maybe that</p>
            <p>code switching is a topic for it's own blog.</p>
            <p>Lol UH America is tough,but I like to think about how Genghis Khan killed like half the population. Griff and a lot of people in American History have fought for peace and a level of safety, and I do believe they have been winning. Look at the tech. I can move between states in hours/ sometimes even an hour. I don't mean to say they are wrong to assume they should be safe...but scientifically, historically that hasn't been the case.</p>
            <p>I use transportation as an example because I've been learning that's the highest level of freedom one can have. Side note- like fuck the limitations of paying for the ticket.</p>
            <p>What you see is what you get. I like that comment. Lately I've been thinking about art and the propaganda machine. It's like as my favorite people make more money they become slaves to it (it being the money? propaganda, politics? I don't know. Something creeps in and makes things fearful.) Fans believe they have some claim to the product. And they do right...feedback and criticism are imported from the fan base. That's why my blog exists. So I can share my love or hate of a topic. Rap has proven that silencing doesn't work. The worst it ever gets is Genghis Khan. And the push back from the attempt created an era of gangsta rap. It's a game. Always a game. maybe this is another blog.</p>
            <p>Back to the vid.</p>
            <p>The dual consciousness...well Griff is speaking directly against alter ego's but I hope to remember to post a vid I saw about the "Lost art of Alter egos" ...Uhh it's art. I'm always me, but I have this Imp that is still developing. It's not exactly the same thing. I'm hoping the imp is a representation of me online. But Our art is a representation of us. And I hope you've been following my blogs enough to know that I consider everything art. e v e r y t h i n g</p>
            <p>Okay. I have to pause the video and really mention the propaganda machine. I mentioned it already but it's super present in the video and they only allude to it while talking about it constantly. To speak it clearly, as artists there is constantly a force seeking to take possession of the art. It's complicated because some professions work on procedure. Art works off creativity. It's one of the most difficult things to sell because it doesn't help one "live". It's not food or shelter, or medicine. However historically all successful civilizations have had strong creative centers. It's a boon to the living standard. So I guess there is surviving and then there is thriving. Once all the crops are planted, what's next. Once someone manages to make a name or begin to receive pay for what they do for free, people want to plant it and cultivate it. Stick Mozart in the ground and watch it grow into more Mozart      But it's never done for free right, I mean the rap and music. IF you're the bard, say what I want you to say. But before I was The Bard I was always saying what I want to say. It the promise of maybe more money and fame, if you sell out a bit. And you're going to sell. Especially in our economy- its designed for that. But the like Griff already mentioned he was paid 1000 a night so artists todays can get paid 25000 a night. Music and art existed before Griff and they made amazing work. That's all.</p>
            <p>"There's a line you're not suppose to cross"</p>
            <p>I'm not going to bring up that line. Actually I guess I have to, rule number one to how to get rich...find the line and fuck it up.</p>
            <p>Cannon brought up the "they's" .</p>
            <p>I already have deep thoughts about "them" too</p>
            <p>It so uncool to be an individual. Everyone wants a platform and by God you better follow it. There propaganda machine moves like that.</p>
            <p>Cannon I got to split. "Pull your self by your own bootstraps"...well my straps fucking broke and I'm still going. That's how it goes.</p>
            <p>Griff Nick you are two illuminated people. "You can't make a fish fly" Somewhere between those two statements I'm loving on people to work and shitting on those that don't.</p>
            <p>Economy doesn't make the sun come up.</p>
            <p>Maybe the story of Cain and Able is a bit too prevalent in our culture. Maybe there was another path. Maybe></p>
            <p>But it's what we got.</p>
            <p>SO on the topic of people controlling people- My dad tried to control me..in a decent way doctor lawyer engineer, but what made him qualified?</p>
            <p>I'm an immigrant...I watch the news...I watch global news...If the blackman was put "sound alseep" go back to sleep.</p>
            <p>Thing is we let advancement (especially through tech) make us think the world is a safe place. Side note The attack on billionaires is ridiculous- socialism is great but they try to kill the individual.</p>
            <p>The light bearers...There's a book on the keepers of the flame. I'm all about it. I get it from Naruto. I get it from the Olympics.</p>
            <p>Would inheritance make you elite? I say no. I'll save it for a blog though.</p>
            <p>I don't mean to say the elites don't exist.</p>
            <p>Why unite? Independence is key. Individuality is key. To unite there must be a common goal. It's human psyche.</p>
            <p>The most important I work I've heard is compassion. I'm an actor. I spend a lot of time with words. I've sat and thought about passion and compassion. I would say there is a sect that practices a lack of compassion and even a lack of passion. I don't know if I would call them blue blood and I don't know if I could consider illuminate bad. Look once when I was in haiti someone sat me down and I think I was afraid of the dark or something and they shined a light in my eye they said see too much light can be bad. The same was for too much darkness. Well let me nowo give haiti all the credit it could have been my sisters boyfriend but it could have also happen like within a year or two my my moving to the states. The roots...</p>
            <p>Marley still died from cancer.</p>
            <p>Bette wear that sun screen</p>
            <p>The robbing killing raping etcetcetc I guess it's been going on but I always thought it was the mentally deranged rather than a people. It's scary that it may be a people. Again I've been in the streets since I was a boy. It wasn't all easy, but that idea of safety was there but comforted by fight or flight. Safety is something to be protected. I don't think anyone just has it...however I do believe that is why people move to cities. Inner city has always been rough but generally the moves comes with more money which is a better life. Then there's the country which is a different lifestyle but "still safe" I mean it's complicated. I don't mean to excuse bad behavior but I don't support ignorance.</p>
            <p>Actually I would say being in the rough snow would have given white folks a different form of dependence. In the sun you want to be away from people because they only give off heat. In the cold you want to be closer to them. The more the merrier. Body heat is sometimes better than turning on a heater.</p>
            <p>And we're breaking at 38 minutes. This kind of makes me regret not working yesterday, but I just sat and watched movies. I don't feel bad.</p>
            <p>Alright and I'm back on it</p>
            <p>NO new thoughts. Jumping right iin</p>
            <p>"To survive we have to take what's not ours"...I was reading this book that I couldn't get through The Dickins Boy. It was a book but maybe it hit close to home...but in it they mention that the native had a tendency of just taking things and they have to be a bit tough. It was only a mentioning nothing big, but uhh I'm native american...uh the idea of property isn't necessarily ingrained in the culture. We share everything, and are a bit spoiled to expect that treatment. I had to learn how to navigate that amongst christians. I mean I've learned that they would watch you starve. It's just cultural. So where I'm headed in this is that I'm 100 percent sure in modern american culture there is a strong mix of native american culture. A cultural habit from one side is possibility being weaponized by the other side. It's complicated but when times get rough right...the two cultures handled things differently.</p>
            <p>Uh the Dickins Boy was set in Australia. rather than America</p>
            <p>I'm reading this other book called the Bird King. There's a bit of a hunt...like so far the main characters are just running away from a huntress. I try not to judge cultures. I always assume I'm surrounded by a million different thought patters and I'm easily ready to laugh or fight. However where I'm going with this one is that The Huntress is part of the Inquisition. How much of white american culture comes from the Crusaders, I don't know, but there's a power grab constantly happening...Personally Crusaders, Inquisitors, Nazi's I know to stay away from. But in these modern times as we get attacked it's important to recognize that it may be people who elect to follow these doctrins. I have my own as well. I'm not any more or less scared than those who stood against them back then. I admit to a power grab, and there is only one source, but we're not all on the same path. There's a lack of fucks on my end.</p>
            <p>"There to great them with open arms" well there was a few others before them. I always wondered how the bow and arrow took over the world. I'm somewhat sure there was some form of trade happening. Like taking to the seas was mighty dangerous for a while. Like once you land do you stay or do you return, and if you return...I mean...It's a complicated imaginary tale.</p>
            <p>Theft of natural resources might be the Eurocentric world view. We walked around with gold all over us. Understanding it for its beauty and simplicity. We had no idea it was as money. I mean I don't think indians recognize "land". Enemy territory, hunting territory, no go zones etc, but when you've got to move, you've got to move. THe issue I run into is slavery. If you need the gold go and get it. That's never a problem. There seems to be a game of getting other people to do things and indians are sensitive to territory...just not "land". The real theft is of time.</p>
            <p>Lol women</p>
            <p>Aye...</p>
            <p>I don't know what to say.</p>
            <p>Juicy J said it best</p>
            <p>You can't explain hate.</p>
            <p>"Life is living in a fear of extinction" real shit. That's the nail on the head. Don't eat for 24 hours...where you gonna be?</p>
            <p>Clearly they've never met a black widow.</p>
            <p>Fear of God.</p>
            <p>Maybe that's why you should love God.</p>
            <p>SO again I'll say "I am God", and follow it with "You can't explain hate, but you can express love"</p>
            <p>Hate isn't what gave the snake its venom</p>
            <p>Africa was named by the Europeans and Europe was named by the Africans. They made that claim. I don't agree or disagree, but I'll use it to make a point. Earlier on this round when I felt compelled to talk about Indians and Americans...the world is defined through interactions. I don't diss cultures but I def don't believe in the man in the sky...or is it space...I don't fucking know it's not my religion. I know people pull up one way and walk out another.</p>
            <p>From a global position we call it Africa. Fuck everyone else and whatever weird as plans they have, I plan on doing a lot of business in Africa. African art with all their resources must be insane. But I still have to figure out where to go? Madagascar? Ivory Coast? South Africa may be a little too commercial. They hosted the soccer or Olympics a few years ago. Central Africa? It's a big ass place. It's disrespectful to just look at the place and be like Africa, but it's disrespectful to expect someone to rattle off names.</p>
            <p>But isn't that very separatist. I mean Detroit is Detroit and Michigan is Michigan, but are you any less Michigan because you're from Detroit?</p>
            <p>Detroit is in Michigan for ye ol foreign readers</p>
            <p>"we need to find our tribe" that's an easy way of saying there's a place for everyone, and not everyone is your friend.</p>
            <p>Indians when a river dries up, we go somewhere else. That's all.</p>
            <p>I accidentally skipped to a dave chappel mention and have no idea how to find my spot. I've watch this already, so we're moving forward from 47.34.</p>
            <p>Fuck these motherfuckers bro. I love the dress. It's fucking hilarious. I saw this totally awesome dutch movie called Bon Bini Holland. Great film. Medea, Great films. Martin Lawrence films GREAT FILMS. Big Momma I think it's called. Don't be so quick to give up a smile. People work very hard for them.</p>
            <p>To that same point, the outside world is up an artists ass. Don't you think they can tell the difference between a character and a person.</p>
            <p>I mean...I've always hated society acting like gays don't exist. Some of these motherfuckers just stepped in shit. They gave themselves no mental barriers. Nick, you're forgiven. Acting like a problem doesn't exist don't make it go away.</p>
            <p>So I was chillign waiting for the library to open up. My phone broke and I'm suer limited to a few tech options. So library it is. And I realized, the seed and the dirt. That's all.></p>
            <p>There is psych warfare. Like when you said hello to a homie and dude pulled his hand away at the last moment. It's not psych warfare, it's emotional warfare. We do it all the time. I realized last night my favorite nickname for a female is puppet. It's what we do when we buy jewelry and try to make them laugh and ask them out and stuff, it's emotional warfare. Try to make them feel good so they give up a little something, the thing is they give it up if you make them feel bad as well...you have to determine the quality of your gift. You have to make a purchase.</p>
            <p>Aye homie..I'm an artist and since leaving college and moving up a rung I feel like queers are all over me for what I can do on stage. Look I go to the strip club for strippers, and I go the the movies for whatever the movies have to offer. Why do I feel like a "piece of meat on stage" is beyond me. Are you paying attention? About 100 different professions moved to make the moment possible.</p>
            <p>But that was a side note. What I meant to say was...it's not theirs.</p>
            <p>Even in a discussion of this height, you're still giving up too much.</p>
            <p>All the best artists always claim themselves, that includes their upbringing. They know it's the only way.</p>
            <p>Crazy I remember being a kid and thinking what rappers were talking about were lies. Now I'm older and understand there's a persona at play, but there still has to be truth, because that's what people want to listen to.</p>
            <p>I mean...black and death...</p>
            <p>And you probably shouldn't reduce your culture to a color.</p>
            <p>On private worship...that's a big word...but I know I don't work for anyone. The only people I fuck with are they ones willing to step up and be like YOOOOOOO, you know.</p>
            <p>The sun reaches everywhere</p>
            <p>Now we're stopping at 57.21. Whew it's been fun. Would love some comments. I've got a few more of these.</p>
            <p>Back at it again. Before I get to it, I want to mention again that there is a psych warfare. I've had my own experiences, with the "dress" and the like. Maybe forgiving Nick isn't quite in my power, but half of the war is intention. Comedy is real, and it's not defined by Shakespeare (where what makes it a comedy is that everyone didn't die in the end). Comedy is taking to the stage with the purpose of making someone laugh. Thank got for Apollo, sometime we fail.</p>
            <p>now 57.21</p>
            <p>There's levels to this shit. Uhh I'm a pretty good dude. I'm happy too. I would happily slay someone, and still be a good person...</p>
            <p>It's a little childish- what Nick is saying, but the situation in general. So the child of the hunter loves to eat meat, it's soooo delicious. But he learns he has to kill his favorite chick. He angry, sad, swears off meat...but you're the child of a hunter...</p>
            <p>You know Grow Up</p>
            <p>alright a lil side note...I'm fucking terrified of the spinx. The fuck. But moving on.</p>
            <p>The Devil is a lie.</p>
            <p>I'm not going to unpack that</p>
            <p>Right...right...There's a bit of a task here. I know how I'm tasked.</p>
            <p>I will say take some shit seriously and shit will just be serious. That's too easy huh. I didn't even unpack my last statement. I guess between working through this talk things have been getting clearer. First there's talk about the American Empire. Though they talk about Africa etc, they are speaking on experience they have undergone in the American Empire. Umm...Someone was dealt an L. A long time ago. I'll tell you I still don't how Egypt made it to my Taino. But it was there and we dealt out an L. I really don't want to make this a history lesson. I'll mention the groups I don't like. The Crusaders, Nazis, and Inquisitors. I mention them only to say that I've always been aware that they surround me. I study, I put the work in, I keep an ear out and stay away from a lot of people. I don't have much belief in government...apparently they believe in a central figure meanwhile I believe in a bunch of cogs. I do my job. And I take it seriously. I take it very seriously...the slave trade made Africa rich as well.</p>
            <p>There's always a system. It's the group running after bulls and the ladies figuring out what to do with them. It's the first seed planted. There's a natural progression that makes total sense, but it's made of people. Play with words, lie, etc, but the truth is always the truth. You cannot lie on the truth. I learned that people really believe their own bullshit. It's the strangest thing. Like I'll fib to get myself out of a hole, but I always know I fibbed.</p>
            <p>Aye bro it's very different that when I swipe my card knowing there is absolutely nothing on it, so go ahead and cashapp $thefermy to keep things like this coming.</p>
            <p>Uhh did it work?</p>
            <p>On the turban, some things I've come to see as mistakes. Abe Lincoln forcing the states not to seceded- horrible decision. We've lost the american empire from that. It started off as 13. Not letting people be racist or wear the swastika, I need to know who you are. I make it clear who I am. But there is no way around interacting with others. I'm a daoist hermetic I know how to be completely alone, and maybe I'm moving towards that, but my dad is christian hermetic and he is there. I didn't want that. You still need to make money. Money is trade and communication.</p>
            <p>No matter what I do, I know I will not get away from people. I have the dao for that.</p>
            <p>Fuck their cointel pro. It's nothing.</p>
            <p>It's nothing because it's not even supported anymore. It's evolved into threats and other things. They'll get nothing from it, and you get nothing being afraid of it.</p>
            <p>And you want something. You want to die with your fingers clawing at something. That's the industrialist way. That's the people who built America.</p>
            <p>Right right...thank mandel or mendeleve, or whoever it is, white america is all about genetics. They are not wrong. But they give no fucks about the spirit of things. There's a lot of magic there too. The source is whole. You don't go to the source looking for bits and pieces. You go to the source not knowing what the fuck it is, and figure it out along the way. And it can protect itself. IT will protect itself. When the attack gets this ridiculous...I know not to give a shit.</p>
            <p>source, path, etcetc, maybe the entity itself. It's the nature of God. A well documented and very appropriate piece of knowledge for a nuclear world.</p>
            <p>YES "The journey of the self, through the self, back to the self" it's all there. It's all there.</p>
            <p>God</p>
            <p>God</p>
            <p>GOd</p>
            <p>GOD</p>
            <p>God</p>
            <p>And maybe I went through the same thing. It's shitty because Griff, Nick, I run businesses. We pick our base. We learn to keep the checks coming by being a working cog within our base. It's how we hunt. There's a machine out there eating businesses. And Ayn Rand had it when she said let that shit burn.</p>
            <p>Trumps having some conversations that I could say are dangerous for me. Nothings a problem until it becomes a problem. I say cointel doesn't matter because they are hacking and reading notes and listening to telephone lines, meanwhile you're just planning. I had a notebook jacked from a car. Just plans. Nothing happens until the cogs on the machine start moving. You can't just imagine a problem.</p>
            <p>And your machine is dependent on other machines. Like fuck that</p>
            <p>Griff is doing it...you can take a horse to water but you can't force them to drink. The info is out there. The book is there. Nick is there.</p>
            <p>This is keeping it to yourself. It's your platform. Your product.</p>
            <p>...It's that L</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 290px;">Good night</p>

                <iframe class="ownNothingFrame" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_DcRF0sEpp8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>Starting here and going into the video above...I have to make an announcement. I'm a capitalist. Shocking I know. My views may be a little biased...maybe too biased because I couldn't get get through either vid without getting heated. To preface I'll say capitalism is tough and rough...and socialism is the next step. But we have to do it properly. Maybe it's a little to early but in the next vid is a Einstein quote. I completely agree. If no one made you go to work, house paid off everything set would you still go? The everyman may have to always worry about paying the bills, the answer for him may be to go somewhere else to make sure he gets paid to handle business. A business owner might give a different answer. Believe me, they've put in 1000's of unpaid unslept unhealthy hours to come up with a product (I haven't even mentioned selling).</p>
                <p>On the topic of collective ownership, there's isn't just one form of capitalism...it seems the dominant form of capitalism is when the boss takes everything and leaves nothing behind...uhh...ummm...where do you work?</p>
                <p>Slavery and capitalism are not the same things.</p>
                <p>There are businesses that actually give company shares to their employees.</p>
                <p>...like even seperate from the above comment you can work at a company for 25 years and spend 25 years buying stock from that company to have some ownership yourself. Imagine the look on everyone's faces when you show up to the board meeting in uniform.</p>
                <p>I get heated from a capitalist perspective, but what I will not do is process this from a slave mindset.</p>
                <p>At what point do you have a company? When was Apple Apple?</p>
                <p>Apple is still that company that started off in a garage. Many companies are still little boys and girls saying hello would you like some lemonade. I want to be a little mean and say unless you have a company you can't speak on this. Like this guy in the video. Uhh actually first let me explain business growth. I have a product it takes X y z ingredients. X takes 25 days y twice that and z thrice. With only 19 clients I can manage it on my own. 20 maybe things start to get rough and I need someone else on z. If I pay the person (and honestly as someone building a company it's the payment process that stands out to me) then what right do they have over the final product or any other ingredient. Or connects!</p>
                <p>I'm listening to music</p>
                <p>BACK</p>
                <p>I had a change of location and had some errands to run.</p>
                <p>Back where I left off...</p>
                <p>I was going to comment on the dude in the video- the content creator market is super lax. One person chooses the subject matter, sets up the camera, shoots, edits, and posts. All alone. The Marquis Brownlee(bad spelling maybe) dude probably handles all his own production, but what if this guy in the video decided to shoot 5 videos at one time? He'd need a fair bit of research on 5 different topics. If nothing else he could chose to hire someone to do only the research for him. Under his own argument his hire owns his work? In my mind(cough cough) where shit is normal (cough) the credit page stands from something. And I mean I understand the problem from a different perspective...I hire artists for images. I've paid no more than $200 so far. And I know that they have released all ownership, but what if after flipping those images for $200,000 they want a bigger cut. I mean I'm not a drawing artist. In the points I look towards the contract. Like shoul a developer get a cut of the restaurants Profit? CAN WE JUST ACCEPT TO GET PAID.</p>
                <p>Okay no one other than the CEO knows what te final product is. I hire artists for a series of images...you don't know for what! Fool.</p>
                <p>Okay on the topic of they want collective ownership but don't care about personal property...at what point is the business collective? I've already said that unless you're a CEO you can't comment. There is no personal life for a CEO. EVERYTHING I OWN IS COMPANY. I EAT COMPANY. I FUCK COMPANY. now I as I expand within my company there is an idea of personal ownership which is important for a company like mine. But it's still very different. I've been listening for years and have already designed a few things to tackle certain issues, but by God not socialism.</p>
                <p>Are people retarded? Do people understand convenience?? Has no one noticed a shell gas station across from each other? Then a BP on the next block? We've been moving toward a more convenient society. This is the society of take the stairs rather than the elevator. Why buy a car when for 9 bucks a month you can rent one at 15 an hour? If you ride more than that buy a car. Get you that ownership booboo. If you don't....maybe you work around the block, grocery is two blocks away, and the bus can take you around the rest of the way. Boom. It's for you....now I know I mentioned the bus. A bunch of scary stuff happens on the bus, and it's not cool to pick up chick's after the club on a bus...BUT IT IS! IT FUCKING IS.</p>
                <p>There's been a throughline that been mixed with safety and convenience that is being thrown away saying "you don't own anything".</p>
                <p>No one said you can't own a house or car or any big purchases. Jewelry. Dude brought up a toothbrush as personal property. Go the fuck to bed.</p>
                <p>Oh please let me cry because I have access to millions of songs for 10 bucks a month. Pease wait while I cry...you know how many albums I have purchased like 5. I started making money after the iPhone. I didn't even have a chance to steal that many songs.</p>
                <p>Millions</p>
                <p>For 10 bucks</p>
                <p>Milions</p>
                <p>Million</p>
                <p>M</p>
                <p>It's a different form of consumption. I recommend buying music and TV. And I'll say that I'm a little pissed that so few people do that Amazon is the only place to get cd's. Look big tech we still want to buy music. But nigga's be broke and it's good to get a taste of the music before we throw down that 12. I don't think that makes me a slave. I think kit kes me rich as fuck...maybe just rich...streaming did kill the listening party.</p>
                <p>Like did th consumer economy die or something? Like everything is so cheap we might as well be slaves. Look fool everything is cheaper including education so pay the fuck attention.</p>
                <p>It's a gym membership. This dude sounds like he's trying to hit the gym with no membership.</p>
                <p>Do you acknowledge Spotify as a real company?</p>
                <p>It's even hard like Amazon, Tesla, Alphabet...like they only do music...you fucking retard.</p>
                <p>Okay...okay...I use google books a lot. The guy mentioned Amazon kindness ability to revoke and they license rather than sell. I don't know if there's a subscription modle for Amazon but I pay for books on Google. I expect the world to crash and still own those books. I mean...he hit me there. If not own expect access on their platform. Like I'm not going to Amazon saying I already bought it on Google....there's something realy wrong overall.</p>
                <p>Okay "ours to do with what we want" as an artist that hit me. I think it was lil nas who brought some nike's then tweaked them himself(or put is name on them behind some company)...uhh...that's some shit I would do. Like...it's like the artist issue I mentioned earlier. Okay here's what I have to say...what if I brought a 100 pair of playboy underwear then had to use them to wipe a oil dipstick. I swear to God I would make every designer in the world cry, but once the product leaves the store there's been an exchange and I believe it belongs to me. On the topic of nas' shoes if I already paid for the Nike symbol then I can design whatever behind that...now reselling is a different thing. There's a lot more you can getaway with if you don't plan to resell.</p>
                <p>So my response is thT it's ours to do with as we want as long as we don't resell...(what about donations and gifts...I'll leave each artist to their own lawsuits)</p>
                <p>Dude remember the extended life battery? Yeah I had that shit...think I can use those in 2022? I can't even open the back of my phone.</p>
                <p>It sounds like I'm on his side there, but if I had a battery failure, if I knew enough I could fix it on my own. I don't have apple. Apple has a different angle. And can mention companies have the right to governthemselves as they seem fit. And not even fit...as they seem creative. I mentioned some companies give out stock and actual ownership. Apple has authorized dealers to fix phones. Like they actually put money behind that shit. A fuck the world fuck ton. I have always been with android not exactly because I saw the apple play but because of the freedom with the software. I move around a lot. Like there's a bit of killing of the personal preferences here. So Apple.</p>
                <p>Despite apple being a very successful company. I don't think apple needs the army it has. I was there. Never forget I was there.</p>
                <p>I love k cup coffee. Are you getting mad at Kerrig for not allowing dollar tree coffee cups? Have you ever tried to eat food from one restaurant in a different restaurant? I'm sure you haven't- you look like you have good home training- but let me tell you, THEY WILL TELL YOU NO. Buy the after market product and shut the fuck up.</p>
                <p>I think my overall feeling will be shut the fuck up. I'm also holed up in a new York homeless shelter until the summer so support at cashapp $thefermy. (It's almost dinner time)</p>
                <p>Also I had left the club and everyone wanted food from different places. I was trying to eat cookout in a French bakery. Miller lyfe.</p>
                <p>I'm not touching the housing market.</p>
                <p>I will say that property only goes up. So...fill in the blanks.</p>
                <p>What the fuck is a universal housing guarantee?</p>
                <p>A homeless shelter for everyone? I'd vote yes. I feel like to bring it back to that Einstein quote there's an evolution of capitalism. The last few years has felt like throwing it away. I feel like the world especially the states is rich enough to say you have a place if all else fails. A social safety net. Capitalists throw their everything at their dreams, and frequently they encounter troubles. Shelter food and their manifestations should be covered.</p>
                <p>Oh God...yes the bank owns it until you pay it off. Where was this in 2008?</p>
                <p>Oh gawd</p>
                <p>Some of this stuff is super base. Start thinking about luxury items then come again.</p>
                <p>No one cares about your toothbrush bro.</p>
                <p>Okay so ownership takes work. Ownership says I bought this. It's mine. I've had a lot of shit stolen,but I know somewhere there is ledger with all my shit. That's fucking ownership.</p>
                <p>And the same for rent. People want to rent the car fuck it up and send it back. Somewhere there is a ledger saying it was under your protection.</p>
                <p>We're getting poorer...uhh okay I'll say that's true but we are more fortunate. Some of our poverty comes from how easy it is to get a dollar. But you have to work for the dollar.</p>
                <p>Yup. Increase profit, cut costs. <------ see how good they've been. Except lol some companies are surviving off debt. There's a problem around here.</p>
                <p>I'm here for it. Are you?</p>
                <p>One of the best things you can do is support cashapp $thefermy</p>
                <p>Yup. Mofo's will do anything not to pay. It's a game. Play the game kiddos.</p>
                <p>Real capitalists don't do that. Happy people happy products. Happy people attract happy customers. Happy customers are rich customers. Rich customers = rich business. None of the companies that stiffed me are doing well these days. None</p>
                <p>What te fuck is n "owner of capital"</p>
                <p>The person who owns the merchandise?</p>
                <p>Dude I worked for a temp company when vuse cigarettes came out and i snapped the cigarette to the battery all day for 5 days a week. Do you think I stood there thinking I own this shit. GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.</p>
                <p>And where do Temps fit here?</p>
                <p>All of this is true. That's why I chose to be homeless. I said pay me this much. They laughed me out the door.</p>
                <p>Who buys so much with debt? Where is all this debt. Some of these vids make it sound like people have an unlimited pool of debt when their money runs out. Where?</p>
                <p>We don't want to own fool.</p>
                <p>Capishe</p>
                <p>Banks. He's saying everything belongs to banks. Fuck a mortgage what about a business loan. With a mortgage you know you don't plan to borrow more. With a business loan you're in the bank begging and paying everyday. Doesn't the bank own me then? Even when THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS</p>
                <p>You're thinking too much.</p>
                <p>If someone tells you can't afford $500, run.</p>
                <p>Run and don't look back. That's a theif.</p>
                <p>I have Spotify, tidal and SoundCloud. They don't all have the same material. Whereas ll of the business comparing coming from. These are all very different companies.</p>
                <p>That's why you resist. That's the ;wee point.</p>
                <p>Capitalists will hear.</p>
                <p>And we're done. Thank God. But there's another one. I might not have it in me.</p>
                <p>Another point that I was trying to work in is purchasing- like wait lists and lux goods where you have to have this before you can get that.</p>
                <p>The American is a complex dream.</p>
                <p>And you don't just own everything. Never.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 290px;">I bring waitlists and tge like up because isn't that the kind of favoritism socialists are against? Then some companies say you cannot resell their products. Lux cars I'm looking at you. Don't these infringe on consumer rights...but like RDJ in blackface we want it.</p>

            <p>You're lying to yourself.</p>
            <p>America has advanced a lot and economic and social control have shifted to reflect other communities. That's not to say that whites have become second class citizens but maybe a little too brutishly people are trying to push white power under the rug (because it's not going anywhere) and applaud a few other powers.</p>
            <p>All lives matter. If you mean it then you mean it.</p>
            <p>You low key acknowledge being the majority in your class. And claim you don't need to be validated but then praise to the minorities make you feel a type of way.</p>
            <p>The majority minority argument is not important to me. However this takes me back to "everyone gets a trophy". Losing sucks. You'll be alright.</p>
            <p>Activism and education. I know this well. The smartest person I know is my dad. Does he do anything with his knowledge. Not quite. That's where I come in. Education is a prerequisite for activism. And education demands activism. I listened to a talk with Adam Newmann and he summed it up. "What are we talking for"></p>
            <p>**if you haven't noticed yet I'm jumping around quite a bit. I could have stopped at the first comment, but this a business and I should give the readers something to read.</p>
            <p>What did this lil white boy say?</p>
            <p>Before he quoted Whites have a pretty good situation right now unquote</p>
            <p>I must apologize for my opinion that you are lying to yourself. I do believe in the game and believe there are whites out there that slip a dog a bone. It must be down right ridiculous for you to be called racist, privileged, and differentiated. That being said I stand by my opinion.</p>
            <p>Docking grades? You could hope they dock grades. People get fired for that.</p>
            <p>Aww man. I was hoping I heard the democrats republican quote here. I forget how I planed to tie it in earlier, but it was probably when you mentioned half the class is white and the other half Latino, Asian (it sounded like there may have been more, but I think that's all you said). I'll say it another way. Democrats hate to lose, Republicans know what it's like to lose.</p>
            <p>Alright I've been studying for a few months now and this is maybe not the fiirrrrst time, but the first time I hear socialism v. democracy rather than capitalism. I've been studying socialism v capitalism since I'm a capitalist.</p>
            <p>THROW IN A QUARTER- cashapp $thefermy</p>
            <p>I guess I have more studying to do.</p>
            <p>Maybe they shouldn't work there. Maybe that's not where they should be. Institutions have a right to push their agenda. That's why institutions are formed. Sure schooling is different, but there are tiers for a reason.</p>
            <p>YAYYYYYY</p>
            <p>Sure it sucks getting shitted on for skin color and political views. I applaud you for the switch.</p>
            <p>Good luck and OoohhhOoo shit.</p>

            <p>I still don't know how the climate factors into the issue. Beyond common sense.</p>
            <p>How does the climate effect debt?</p>
            <p>Comment below</p>
            <p>Man made issues with Venezuela being an example (poor investments)</p>
            <p>Okay okay so it looks like a point was made where if the country is dependent on dams for electricity, and a drought occurs that can be catastrophic. That's a big way the climate can affect debt.</p>
            <p>Doomsday bunkers...billionairs and eccentrics get a bad rep...I think.</p>
            <p>Okay I'd say the guys filming or producing and directing are billionairs. And this is from a billionaire pov. I'll note the "eat the rich" culture. I'll save most of my views for a blog. But the idea that a builder will dig up a bunker is ridiculous. Like comment share support to find out why in the future.</p>
            <p>*the vid...I'm a couple 0's shy of a billion. Cashapp $thefermy</p>
            <p>I've done a lot of research on the 2008 crash especially. My mindset is if you send you money out expecting/knowing you'll get more back, then you did nothing wrong.</p>
            <p>Debt traders...don't quit your 9-5</p>
            <p>Again...I'm confident that climate change is really about water. Now I cannot negate the other issues. I can say well the high heat will melt the caps and produce more water, but that's very shortsighted because of long dead virus'. Then the hot regions will only get hotter, droughts will kill crops we've grown dependent on. I get it. It's absolutely terrifying. Wind energy will be hit as well. Nuclear may be the only option at this point. Solar is slow money.</p>
            <p>Sidebar: dude said you got to clean the sidewalk, buy sidewalks are public property. I'm not captain save a hoe, call me captain shoot a cop.</p>
            <p>Reaganomics- I only know it in name...that's next though. Stay tuned. This just became a series.></p>
            <p>Right the American system is roman...and I'll break there for now.</p>
            <p>I'm back!</p>
            <p>Hella accents in the vid</p>
            <p>Thoughts formulated...on the topic of the Roman system failing and it's parallel to current times the host says "except it'll be the whole world". America isn't global. It's not necessarily America's fault. The millenials are gone. They were the only generation raised global. All the others were wolves, and if you read back in my blog millennials were completely oblivious of the generation game. So the whole world may burn, but not like Rome.</p>
            <p>It's like what everyone else keeps saying. Whatever's coming is going to be ridiculous, unexpected, and in no way prepared for.</p>
            <p>The above is just my opinion though.</p>
            <p>Next solid point, Americans build homes everywhere. Even in dangerous places. I don't know if this is a thing in "other or many countries". My reason is that we're super capitalist. Or homes or towns revolve around the biggest business in the area. Desert towns and run down cities come from this behavior. If I haven't done a blog on this yet, I will. It's a mental shift, but it should be completely affordable compared to the past.</p>
            <p>Uninsurable homes...companies looking into where a future flood may happen and decline to insure a home of area of homes. Uhh..this reminds me of the tobacco smoker...uhh we know how that goes.</p>
            <p>So now my ignorance comes in. I mean it was explained. But (maybe) like essentially your mortgage money comes back to you. Maybe insurance plays a bigger role in that than just a flood or fire...l mean clearly once they list your home in a flood area things are more bleak than if it weren't. I guess your insurance options will help drive up the cost of your home, or down. And you're counting on that money for retirement, college, selling profit, etc. Big bleak shit.</p>
            <p>"Nature is going to be the eroding (factor) to our economy". So I hope you've been enjoying me realizing why the last 5 years have been all about climate change.</p>
            <p>So...even in my 30 years on earth it's easy to forget money comes from some place. Generally we have two sources in America government and personal (1buck would do, but we generally mean billionaire).
            The thing is...there are a million solutions...but uhh money has go to the right place and the options to fix presented to us are slow returns. American culture is cash cow culture.
            Again it takes a mental shift, that the richest and freest generation, can totally afford.
            </p>
            <p>So for my altruistic folks "climate change" has nothing with Earth day or the like...the earth will be fine. That's what I've been confused as hell about the last few years. Rather it is only our designs that are at risk. Again our moves and actions are leveraged on home ownership. Homes while usually we study seiges and wars or burglary have another conqueror, God.</p>
            <p>The threat is that He'll knock them down faster than we can build them. Erosion is a thing mates.</p>
            <p>A buck will do, just play your part. -Fermy</p>
            <p>I'm pretty sure Somalia will do just fine against climate change.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 290px">And finally only Jeff Bridges can root this.
            Fin...
