            <p>And we're off.</p>
            <p>As always I've got to plug the website. www.afermyboutique.com. There's a few more of these on there and hte list is growing. There a lot more there to.</p>
            <p>There's fun for having!!</p>
            <p>I love experiencing these worldviews so I've got to shout out Signifier.</p>
            <p>This thing is about 2 hours long so I doubt I'll get through the whole thing today. If I don't I'll get on it tomorrow.</p>
            <p>After that wonderful intro by X I have to say that I've been thinking about parties like the black panthers. I don't truly believe these to be socialist organizations. Here's the thing- even in propaganda which is mainly owned by whites (and their control is dwindling because of the internet) black is money. Analyze movies where even though the skin is white they use the color black in dress and attitude and the character and setting is rich. That's one example. Specifically on the black panthers I can't get behind the idea that they were socialist. The program that stands out the most to me is the school lunch program. I know it seems socialist on the surface but the root of communism and socialism is commune (or even commune) and social. There's a togetherness in these words by definition, but the same is true for society. Kennedy's famous quote of "think not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country" should never be forgotten. Yes there is togetherness, but still the individual must do their part. As a business owner I identify an obstacle and then plan to profit from it. I know I know...capitalism, but for the panthers I think their social programs were a way to ensure there would be doctors and lawyers and teachers in the ranks of the future. They identified the obstacle, and families banded together to make lunches to make sure every child had the food. At the end of hte day someone had to pay. The word I'm looking for here is invest. I think they made an investment rather than just say every child will have a sandwich at school. And that is very capitalist.</p>
            <p>Also like comment share.</p>
            <p>IF you want to be SOCIAL then get incvolved. Start here.</p>
            <p>Also before I press play...I've done more research on socialism. Look it is my belief that maybe the soviets and other like worlds were a bit too early with their development. I truly believe that socialism is the future, but it has to be done right. Today like in the past it seems like its either this or that. I believe in limited government. But someone has to consider that we need a road here nowish. Someone has to consider that placing radioactive waste in the oceans is dangerous and they have to have the power to prevent that. That's not capitalism or socialism, that's government responsibility. I've been following Milton Freidman and he put himself in the position were his believes were tried and tested by his contemporaries. I've started the series from the beginning but the one that got me started was actually the episode on the welfare system. It's not the first second or third in his series. During the talkback a black congress man or lawmaker said he was mad because Milton's video was only half the story, because he didn't speak on pretty much the fact that people are horrible. Sometimes a man cannot find a job no matter how hard he tries, and sometimes should he get one...there's an emotional or mental price to pay. Milton didn't speak on the abuse of the system, and the welfare system does. However; there are clear benefits to the capitalism that grew from fiefdom, and I cannot get behind a movement that wants to erase those gains. I am still an individual in a group, but in society it takes a group to get the work done, but I would never count out the individual. From my understanding moving like this will only take society back to fiefdom.</p>
            <p>Pressing play</p>
            <p>Black people voted republican for generations. I don't have the factoid but I'm pretty sure these were the share cropper blacks. Also parties flip flop. I mean...it's a two party system. There's a clear issue in that alone.</p>
            <p>First things first I don't think republican or democrat is the problem for black advancement.</p>
            <p>I don't know about MLK being anti capitalism. Also I don't think white folks need an excuse to kill blacks.</p>
            <p>The bus boycott was the most powerful form of capitalism that I know.</p>
            <p>Yep same bird.</p>
            <p>What's funny is that you can't tell someone what to put their money into.</p>
            <p>You've got to learn to let people fail and succeed on their own.</p>
            <p>I get the Malcolm speech, but again...you've got to let them realize it on their own. It sucks I know. Fiefdom took hundreds of years to collapse. It was never over night. For it to advance it needed the rich and the poor. The owner and the worker to realize okay lets give this new thing a try.</p>
            <p>I don't know enough about MLK or X to really speak on these statementss.</p>
            <p>But I do know that to advance you have to go forward, and I'm pretty good at identifying backwards.</p>
            <p>Black lives matter is an important piece in all of this. Man if only they were capitalists.</p>
            <p>Its a complicated subject to touch. Uhh I guess I'll try. Really quickly. Hush money is real. It's not just political. Sometimes you have to really think about whether you want to sell or keep building. Whatever. I will say that understanding the struggle you should remember that MLk and X were killed and think if that's really a bad thing.</p>
            <p>It's a funny thing about America. White America does not have the same feeling of togetherness that black folks have. Maybe their togetherness has grown since Trump, but I don't think they are capable. White propaganda is full of backstabbing and double crosses and that's their own propaganda. It's not a bad thing. I've learned to understand it. Once when I was a boy a few ladies asked for help putting something in their car and my dad said no. I've thought about that a lot as a boy. If we all live on one planet why would I not help my common man. and it should be no surprise that the root is capitalism. I understood that at the time, but still you know not everything is about money. That's not the only form of currency and doing the right thing feels good and is a kind of currency. I've experienced that people are straight evil. They suck at it, because it's rather pointless, but they do try their best. White America is accustomed to that evilness I guess it followed them from fiefdom to imperialism and capitalism and it's still here.</p>
            <p>I don't know if a conservative would even consider legislation to give another man assistance. Does the white man have legislation ensuring their domination. ... ... no...No. They do it through scare tactics and military intervention and embargos. There's very different. I know there is an argument that blacks were re-enslaved after Lincoln in a really roundabout way but the laws don't add up. If you pass an illegal law then it's illegal.</p>
            <p>Dangerous jobs exist. Like the people who repair electrical poles. Like they do it regardless. I wouldn't not want to be free just because it's dangerous.</p>
            <p>Yup. It's a horrible pattern. You can't speak on the black community without speaking about the police. That's like talking about the fox everytime you read a book about the rabbit.</p>
            <p>Imagine the Irwins being like lets go check out the rabbit cage folks that's the rabbit but LOOK AT THAT FOX. ITS BIG SCARRY TEETH. LOOK LOOK LOOK AT HOW SHARP IT IS bring the camera in LOOK AT THOSE CHOMPERS.</p>
            <p>I caught myself earlier. In the last post I almost wrote black issues. Instead I wrote the black community. I really don't mean to talk about black issues when I think about the black community. There's a lot more to a community than its issues.</p>
            <p>How would you having more money change how the police behave. They still gone steal yo watch.</p>
            <p>You do know that the police move illegally right.</p>
            <p>Well when they do.</p>
            <p>It's not like the police have a legal right to be complete idiots. Back in the 70 80 and 90's there was a rule. BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY.</p>
            <p>I get mad because the fact that this rule isn't at the fore front of every community can be an example that things have really gotten better. (Except for the drug issue)</p>
            <p>I lost my subscription and I have to sit through ads. CASH APP $afermyboutique or paypal.me/afermyboutique.com to hook a brotha up.</p>
            <p>Well before he talks about Louis F I'm go heat up some oatmeal. Be back in 10</p>
            <p>back</p>
            <p>slip into the comment section holmes</p>
            <p>Don't be surprised if I don't say much in this section. I don't know anything about the man or the religion?</p>
            <p>I don't really want or need to post this but after an artist shares their music and after fame and hella interviews its normal for them to spew their ish. It's part of their identity. It's not like they got famous preaching.</p>
            <p>I wonder if Signifier's got anything positive from the NOI. or even Jews. If the Jews own "everything" and the NOI has the most resources in Black America...what have you learned.</p>
            <p>You know I'm not really into the division. We're on Louis F and I really don't know much about the man, I guess at least the next two sections are going to be more division. There a sub section on Garvey...what I want to know is what did you learn. I don't think you have to join the NOI, but I'm more interested in what they did right and wrong and what I can fill my lil doggy bag with. prech and thank you.</p>
            <p>Is Garvery where Dashiki come from? get it...</p>
            <p>Well okay...the reason why I said that was because of pan Africanism and he just said Garvery wasn't associated with it.</p>
            <p>It's funny when it comes to blackness it's a take it or leave it thing. Why can't the brother just share his thoughts and get paid? Is Umar the leader Louis is. Because I under Louis being a leader, but I see Umar is a motivational coach. Him and even that dude that was teaching his kid daughter to shoot. It's social media. I see it as them sharing a piece of their lives, not necessarily trying to spur a revolution or even be a revolutionary.</p>
            <p>Oh you're looking fo ra revolutionary...</p>
            <p>Personally I know these guys are black nationalists...where oh where they would get the money to fund social programs only you can tell me.</p>
            <p>When I say socialism is the next level after capitalism I mean these societies have the capital to fund these programs. It's a luxury. The black national of the 60's likely would not, and they capital would be put to better use building the brand.</p>
            <p>The black Muslim is old but new in American media. As time progresses more performers have claimed their faith. I don't know if the NOI is muslim but this could play a part.</p>
            <p>I'm inclined to ask what it means to act more like white people.</p>
            <p>I think he's about to bring up Cosby. Cosby is the last person I know to have said "By Any Means Necessary"</p>
            <p>I a video, but still.</p>
            <p>Men are made, not born.</p>
            <p>I just said what Cosby just said. You gotta take the positive with the negative.</p>
            <p>I stayed quiet for a minute, but look man the cops don't like me. And honeslty my politics are libertine, I don't mind a world without police. What does this mean...nothing.</p>
            <p>I say they don't like me and I could give a fuck about them...so I really can't say much when Signifier talkes about police brutality.</p>
            <p>The streets are dangerous. Good.</p>
            <p>Who does Signifier look up to?</p>
            <p>It's weird to me when socialists ask for money. I mentioned earlier that I did some research and part of what I researched is what do people from socialists do. My source was ChatGPT and it gave me work replies like work out health care or something in the service industry, but I clarified that I meant in the free time. The reply was go to the park or state activity. I don't know...it doesn't have to be so whack, but it does sound like bingo night.</p>
            <p>Socialism is the welfare state. There are degrees to how much welfare. But if you preach for a government checks it means something to me when you ask for private money.</p>
            <p>Like everyone make s the same money. It doesn't matter what you do. If we all make 50 bucks...would you still ask for private funding?</p>
            <p>There's a word. Financial literacy.</p>
            <p>Again financial literacy. Maybe dude wants his money a little quicker or something.</p>
            <p>Bank. That's a good word.</p>
            <p>Did you know that people are using themselves as a bank through whole health insurance. Look it up. Don't say I never did anything for you.</p>
            <p>Take the risk. Why so serious?</p>
            <p>They killed Lincoln. I mean I use they loosely. But either ay dude was killed. He freed the slaves. and today the narrative is "he didn't" or "not all". Either way...are events like Tulsa really surprising?</p>
            <p>There's more than enough money for everyone to want to get rich.</p>
            <p>I wanted to comment earlier when the time was proper that the music industry is different because the industry is so broad that the musicians are able to be their own business. This was when he was saying that black industries are just off shoots of white industries. I didn't comment because I mean it's still kind of true. Generally the person offering the contract is a white person. Now I regret that...because</p>
            <p>well I lost it. I rewinded but I can't find it. If I find it I'll post.</p>
            <p>Okay I lost it...I regret that I didn't post at the time so the thought could have made sense, but now Signifier is going in on the caps. The last statement "They only got rich from their connection to us" uhh that's a bold faced lie. Jay Z sold music to my knowledge and built himself up from there. Jay Z and Dame Dash is the move. I know more about Dame than J but I don't doubt J has the same mind. They didn't get rich from "connection". Jay Z sold product. It's not that hard getting rich.</p>
            <p>Signifier is defining the process through this exploitive lens...exploitation exists but that not what Jay Z did. You were never forced to listen to his music. Jay is a second generation rapper, I know whites were shitting on rap music and I had to sneak to listen to his stuff. What happened was the complete opposite of exploitation.</p>
            <p>I don't even know how he can make these claims.</p><p>Is it because you had to pay for his music. Sound cloud exists. Plenty of people do it for free.</p><p>I can't speak for Jay Z but I know businesses don't build products racially.</p>
            <p>Or maybe I should replace businesses with capitalists.</p>
            <p>America is a strange place. You should really remove class based slang. Slang being a real language. Words like King Queen do nothing to contribute to the American constitution. I say this because legally there is no class struggle (only class mobility), but thinking makes it so.</p>
            <p>I have to note that capitalism is completely fake. The system of making money and trading it for goods is completely fake. It's all fake and imaginary. If you know you know. And when you know you understand that the money is unimportant. Therefore the conception of rich versus poor is even faker than the money that makes it up.</p>
            <p>Upper class middle class whatever class is trash.</p><p>10 percent 1 percent 1 percent of 1 percent...trash talk.</p>
            <p>lol</p>
            <p>The police shit sounds terrifying, but if it sounds like the army, that's not really something the army does. Just know that you can ask a army man from Afghanistan or Iraq if they shot someone and they would smile and say no. or they would be angry they didn't see any action.</p>
            <p>I just mean that it's not 10 men drafted and 10 men in the trenches.</p>
            <p>But I do need to ask what makes to police think they need all these tools.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 290px;">And we are done. I did the whole thing in one sitting. This may have been my favorite from FD. Thanks</p>

            <p>Thirty minutes fuckers</p>
            <p>I'm excited.</p>
            <p>My first experience with FD Signifiers material was when he spoke on The Black Panther film. I didn't agree with everything he said, but he made me think.</p>
            <p>I have a lot of fun doing these reviews. Check out the rest...www.afermyboutique.com/live.html</p>
            <p>And we're off. I'm here, are you . Click the the vid above and keep an eye on the comment section.</p>
            <p>Alright...I'm already not liking the title change. Somehow it's about MLK now and it doesn't feel centered on black conservatives. I don't like it. It feels like I might be walking into something I'm not down for.</p>
            <p>But gotta love MLK</p>
            <p>I mean I can't comment on history..!</p>
            <p>Solid beat. We'll see where it goes.</p>
            <p>I guess he's like hearing these guys in his head...I think that's the idea.</p>
            <p>YOOO I don;t know shit about black hair.</p>
            <p>Oh but this is a horrible place to start.</p>
            <p>Okay we're starting with physical appearence. Very black..You'd be surprised. I'll let it slide.</p>
            <p>Wyatt Earp</p>
            <p>I can swear on penalty of death that those guys have very long schedules.</p>
            <p>Guantanimo If I'm lying.</p>
            <p>There's something about conservatives I don't know. I know republicans, but whenit comes to conservatives...is that like turning off the lights when you're not using it...because some people leave the light on...and it's a thing. But hold on...the words and terms are flying all over the place and I need a better idea of what a conservative is.</p>
            <p>Okay I haven't pressed play in the vid yet, but I did a bit of googling. The thing is if I lean on the media- republican and conservative kind of mean the same thing to me these days. The google search didn't make me feel any different. I didn't have to do a search on democratic views and found it intriging that they have a super big thing for the middle class. It's just that reading the republican values I was like...yeah of course...how can there be another party (since it's two party blagh). I had to do the search because FD main video definitely said conservatives and I mentally replaced it with republican. That's what made me what to do this. So maybe it's not so weird that the title shifted over to something to do with MLK...</p>
            <p>play</p>
            <p>I won't push my political views...I don't think combatting Signifyers views is why I wanted to blog...but in response to "why are there so many black republican youtube channels"...WHY NOT FOOL.</p>
            <p>Dude even commented on the likes or subscribers lol</p>
            <p>There seems to be a bit of what...a mild case of group-think coming from signifyer (S from here on out). It's a little hostile my guy. A lil hostile.</p>
            <p>The good ol bootstrap life. Pick yourself up, because no one will help you. Nor should you accept help. It's like a top secret message every movie I watched growing up had a man offer help only to have their hand smacked away by the fallen. (Don't say it means nothing- I'm a drama major, it's all in the details)</p>
            <p>Also black culture is full of blacks who learned to read on their own. And that's the first step to being freee...</p>
            <p>I wish I could have heard the question because mama just went off som something...I don't know what though</p>
            <p>hoesntly she's speaking like a republican.?</p>
            <p>Okay...third time listening to her...I'll hazard and say that she is saying that black leaders have fought for socialist rights and white america have fought to make it seem like it's exclusively white. Uhh I wouldn't say that education and health care are socialist ideas. I mean If you want a populace that know how to speak (the same language) then government has to play a hand in that. I'm republican..and..I mean I can see a life where I home teach my children but just imagine the things they wouldn't be able to pick up on. They would know my language and my language only. No matter how good or bad it is. Health care professionals- the ER can't turn people away...it's the backbone. You let someone with a swollen foot keep a swollen foot and they die...I mean as a capilitist I think about how much money that is in the longer run(including offspring).</p>
            <p>See this third dude brings me to a thing I've been understanding more and more of the last few months. If I were rude I would shout- JUST BCEAUSE YOU CAN SPEAK, DOESN"T MEAN YOU FUCKING SHOULD. But the face of the matter is the technology gives a mic to each and every single one of use. More to the point of what homie was saying pay attention because if the nuance doesn't come of a source you trust with your life, mind body and soul, you shouldn't listen. Again I've said that sometimes people argue and it's a bot on the other end. You won't win, it's not even programmed to consider.</p>
            <p>See how they switch from democrat and liberal...WTF</p>
            <p>Words are different for a reason.</p>
            <p>Being thirsty is not the same as being parched.(butcherd spelling, but it still stands)</p>
            <p>Do you guys even undersand nuance</p>
            <p>Wow. S just tried to define liberals a little before 11:29 and I guess I agree with him. The thing is no matter what you are it's about capital at the end of the day. It is what it is. But Like I mentioned earlier democrates have a specific interest in teh middle class, and even from what I say on google...there isa bit of a fuck everyone else kid of feelthere. Well...th words were like we'll help you get there...I've been there...HELL NO. Let's see what he has to say about republicans.</p>
            <p>NO.</p>
            <p>Okay so FD is saying that democrats show support but have problems delivering...That's the cunundrum of business in teh first place.</p>
            <p>Why</p>
            <p>There's a lot happening from within the bubble of the hood...Like do people really expect their lives to change drastically just because there's a new president? Like there's like 10 people who benefit from a new president. The rest of us...it's the street cred.</p>
            <p>well not street cred...street currency</p>
            <p>I see politicas as one part of the machine. Not the whole thing.</p>
            <p>Have you seen the cops though LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL</p>
            <p>LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL</p>
            <p>fuck em</p>
            <p>So I agree with him saying that R and D's are forms of capitalism- that's when he started listing all of those places. Then does he back track and say that being on the left which is D is being anti capatalist- aka not what you just described?</p>
            <p>Do you know a thing?</p>
            <p>All of those companies you listed do good for society...live without them then come and talk to me.</p>
            <p>These companies are close to the House and Senate for a clear reason..I haven't heard it mentioned anywhere? You do know they regulate the market...and sometimes you need to "go to work" on a piece of regulation...money and protest are the only two ways I've seen it done.</p>
            <p>I'm looking at this from the lobbiest perspective.</p>
            <p>lobbyest</p>
            <p>The thing is on the other side you have moms and scientists and conversely the business' looking to make a profit. If a vally of kids get sick, they complain, someone might get elected running on the promise to stop what ever caused it...but lets say we ditch the evil company for now...and let's say the company spends the proper resources to make their product safer than it was...they would have to lobby to get their product back on the shelves. That's dinners and court side tickets...etc along with the fines and fees...</p>
            <p>It's hard out here for a pimp.</p>
            <p>I'm hoping you explain your dream society.</p>
            <p>Oh hell no</p>
            <p>Capitalism wins again</p>
            <p>Uhhhhh</p>
            <p>Did you just list your entire politcal life on the fact that you could be killed.</p>
            <p>Ceaser died in the senate</p>
            <p>It's glory to die for the vote.</p>
            <p>Not really</p>
            <p>But on the list of things to fight for...</p>
            <p>the vote is one</p>
            <p>did you just..what?</p>
            <p>Yooo I'd rather be unemployed or told to go home early then sweep the same aisle for 5 hours. DAFUQ</p>
            <p>You're capatilist...you're suppose to find some alternative way of supporting yourself.</p>
            <p>Does any one black person in that sect speak for the whole sect</p>
            <p>Kanye is a billy</p>
            <p>I'd study hi.</p>
            <p>I do actually.</p>
            <p>Alright I had to bring it back to hear Abrams speak again, and after hearing it for a second time...what does women have to do with the vote...What is the candidate running on to make that thought possible...You gotta treat politics like the stock market. If you know you know.</p>
            <p>I wish she explained what a turnout voter is...but what she said makes sense</p>
            <p>I took that she was saying that black voters are treated like yes..."please vote for me", but really the issue is "will they even vote" Like the point of "pealse vote for me" is a waste because they won't vote not even for your enemy...So technically they system is treating them just like white independants...</p>
            <p>Those are all capatalist examples. And it's okay to mix...the two are not so seperate...that's what the nuclear famliy is and even friends. But all of theose examples were capitalist.</p>
            <p>well</p>
            <p>That explains a lot...that's cool. I'm happ I know that.</p>
            <p>I be fuckin it up.</p>
            <p>The system isn't necessarily rigged. You're scared for your lives. I mean it sounds like two very different issues.</p>
            <p>Okay this issue again...Once more...uhhh so business represent large groups of people...when mothers get mad they tend to repersent the family and families. So Technicaclly in a country where the majority takes precedence over (fuck yall) the minority do you see where big business would hold so much sway. And moms have a fuck ton of heat. Men...I'm haitian...from what I know as carribeans we are stringently independent. That means we have a caution before mixing with a group. I mixed with America under Obama. I DON'T GIVE A FUCK WHAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE> It's not the contract I signed.</p>
            <p>BLING BLING cashapp- afermyboutique or paypal.me/afermyboutique</p>
            <p>PAYPAL.COM
                Pay A Fermy Boutique
                </p>
            <p>I don't agree but it's all good...the two aren't so seperate.</p>
            <p>Again I can't contradicct, but I learned some capatilism from King. Dude said yo we gon walk carpool bike fly, but we will not give these fools a dime until we can sit where we please. I see where it mizes. The thing is I could never get a group together and say "do this". That's...whatever that is...but there was some real capital behind that...and I bet a few colors made more than a lil pocket money.</p>
            <p>That sounds super agrarian. Human needs v. Profits for.... I'm all about the profits. You klnwo naturally slavery has some consequences. Like having to be agrarian in 2023 because you feel so little support from the government...I mena the industrial revolution happened 100 years ago.</p>
            <p>I'm gonna leave that sock puppet alone. It was a sock puppet. puppet</p>
            <p>Well...I don't know what to tell you. No free meals.</p>
            <p>It's odd. From my perspective I see the door to prosperity wide open. If you're 14-49 even 59 there should be no question that you should go through it. But rather blacks in america believe that government asistence is the goal. The 1960's was brought up and it was mentioned a lot- usually in the context that since The Great Society was passed and that created the welfare state. And some say that that is the reason why things are so very tough in america today.</p>
            <p>The great society created the welfare state...the current state of blacks and the need to keep them dependent on the state for whatever reason is the reason why they get so much hostility.</p>
            <p>In my opinion you have to fall for it...it's a joke. But not really because there is good. I'm on food stamps. but it can be abused. The system is capitalist and it refuses to just hand over a decent living wage for free.</p>
            <p>I feel like there's an age limit to the game. At a certain point you have to kill them or leave them alone, but that's also understanding that times have changed. You did what you did so that the next could grow up a kind of way...so that in turn they could fight their fight as well. Like I call the civil rights moverment a war. I consider it the civil right war. Too many people died ( not just MLK and X), and too many shots fired.</p>
            <p>The black panther food drives were socialist...I actually can't make that claim. I don't kow who funded...whatever I think it's a huge mistake to try to catorgorizeeverything into this or that. Business is a mix.</p>
            <p>Like everything is relative...so for the kids it could have been socialist but who knows what the parents or founders had to pay...</p>
            <p>Yeah I was thinking that. It's sounded like you whoa I don't even know how to word it...uh that is without being super racist and disrespectful. Let them do them. Kind of like the loyal ones know they were loyal even on the stake.</p>
            <p>I wonder if he could sum up a statement made my Sowell or Owens.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 290px">Oh god...Maybe I'll do the part two. I'll let the algo deside. THAT"S IT FOLKS. LA FIN</p>

            <p>It's coming...like comment share, so you don't miss it</p>
            <p>And we are on. I've already watched this, so it not as fresh as my last commentary. I've got pent up ideas and whatnot. Should be juicy though. The vid sure is.</p>
            <p>As always jump in and comment. These are always open.</p>
            <p>Alright right off the bat were talking about semites. I've done a bit of research on this way back in the day. In my personal world view the Middle East is a part of Africa. I can be an ass an throw in a few European countries in there as well. The reason is that so much cultural exchange happened in that region. The "look up the list" he is talking about, their area is really situated in the middle east, near the Aegean sea. That whole area (and I can be a double ass and include some of India) is African as fuck. My personal opinion, but with hella research.</p>
            <p>I don't know Griff or his hustle, but it sounds like he was being targeted with bit of career assassination.</p>
            <p>The assassination was by being accused of being an anti semite. He argued that that couldn't be him because the semites are black and he is black. Personally I'm going to switch over to African. It's a complicated subject right off the bat. Just by switching to African I've caused a rift. But I do believe that that is the argument he is making. To call Africans, black, is a little muddling to the hundreds of cultures that live on the continent (I've already included the middle east and India to complicate it further.) Black I think is the cultural name of the American Blackman. But I know within that culture, definitely in the 80's back to Africa movement, the American blackman identified with Africa as his homeland. Today uhh it's not a super popular opinion. It may not have been a "popular opinion" in the 80's either, but it was big enough to have a movement. Since Griff is sharing his story I'll say that he is one of the blacks who identifies with Africa as his homeland going so far as to claim the semetic region as is motherland.</p>
            <p>I'm going to apologize and excuse any proper uppercasing and lowercasing.</p>
            <p>Homie said it twice so I'm going to say it again..."There are 6 major corporations that control everything we watch and see"...Do I agree with this, yes, but to an extent. The everyday man has a lot more control over what gets produced. There may be a bit of a game being played behind the scenes but there's a lot more freedom than 20 years ago when I would have agreed with that statement 100 percent.</p>
            <p>The 6 people is a little too simple. These are multilevel organizations operated by hundreds of people who are constantly revolving. One thing I know, corporate America is cutthroat. Respect the game.</p>
            <p> a shitty meme that revolved a few years ago, but it was something along the lines that unless people are trying to kill you you're not doing enough. This is about the section where Nick talks about conversations that can get you in trouble.</p>
            <p>It's always the people closest to you.</p>
            <p>I feel it. It's a fine line to walk. "Walk the line" I think is the saying. I never really thought about it. They talked about how they started off getting 1000 a night (mind you the money was different) to artists today who can get paid 25000 a night, but they're on the same playing field. It's a forward moving machine. But Griff talks about how he "messed it up for everyone". He mentioned how, but it flew over my head. I grew up in an environment where everyone shared their mind and everyone made fun of everyone. Things were free that way. Griff's time was 30 years before mine but it's that forward moving machine again. Everyone looked at him like damn man...but he mentioned truth. That's the only real thing we own in this world.</p>
            <p>But in defense of the game once money is on the line everyone acts different. In Griff's defense at least he stayed true.</p>
            <p>Silencing and cointelpro was just brought up. and Farrakhan.</p>
            <p>It's what they did to Griff.</p>
            <p>Their enemies don't like rappers. I'm a DJ. I'm an artist first though and enjoy good art. Nick mentioned the propaganda machine. And I studied enough artwork to wonder why everything is so cryptic. Be it drawings or lyrics. I've attracted my own "interests" to question my youthful beliefs, but I always thought that adults got something else from songs than I did as a child. Not necessarily cryptic, but muffled. And in artworks like paintings I thought they tried to send a message that would withstand the test of time. But now I'm older and a bit more knowledgeable on the inner workings of the struggles that artists go through to get their work presented and recognized. It's a gorgeous piece of work, why was the artist shunned why what it trashed...It's a lot moire complicated that "you're too young to listen to these lyrics".</p>
            <p>Maybe there is more to the 6 corporations.</p>
            <p>But are they there to make money or to control the masses. You can't do both.</p>
            <p>Self hate is a thing...</p>
            <p>Griff is talking about claiming and ownership. I'm not trying to get into the blackman culture, and neither were Griff and Nick. But we know the game and the plays. They are looking beyond tthat.</p>
            <p>Rap in its raw. Trust me I've got plans. If recording is an issue there was a time when there were no recordings. You had to be there.</p>
            <p>On the topic on of Farrakhan and "White Devil". Opinion is a thing. I've had my opinion attacked at a very young age. Like it was stupid because I had just learned what it is. I've run into cops multiple times. One thing I cannot do is get mad when they find cause to use force. If the man says he felt threatened, then he felt threatened. Either the Law or God will decide if he was right. There is a bit of an attitude where we disregard peoples emotions and that is the only evil I can process in the world. An emotion is fact.</p>
            <p>Art and propaganda vibrate on two different levels.</p>
            <p>Propaganda has a negetive connotation but ads are propaganda. It's how you sell a product. No matter where someone is on the political spectrum...it's about selling and making money.</p>
            <p>These guys get super meta. That's why I had to make this into a discussion post. Living in a way is about getting as close to the source as possible.</p>
            <p>Everything is the most dangerous thing in America. There are certain logical fallacies that exist, and when the environment starts to look at everything as an enemy...it's time to roll out.</p>
            <p>Kanye. They brought up Kanye. I never "follow" anyone, but in a country like America I take certain cues. They said watch the throne, then Kanye followed with Yeezus. He said I am a God. If we follow Nietzsche, and we do; then we killed God. We know the Earth like the back of our hand. Kanye in my mind was the first motherfucker crazy enough to put forth the superman, and he was doing it even before "I am a God". I can do on, I won't; like I said, I never follow anyone.</p>
            <p>"We're gods having a human experience"</p>
            <p>I think you have to claim the big G. There's no fear.</p>
            <p>Divinity and saluting others. What I know is that what doesn't work will not work. Cultures tend to take over because they are doing something right. Nobody wants to die. The industrial revolution is proof of that. It may have gotten lost, but it is an individual experience. Ford left space for the next Ford. The industrial revolution stemmed from the teaching of Nietzsche and recognized the man in the machine.</p>
            <p>Griff commented that he is from the people who created civilization. There were a few cradles, but the Mesopotamian cradle practically invented math. I don...I mean it's clear how...but damn.</p>
            <p>There is a thing with recognition in the American system. I don't want to to give up hope of it, but how do you force someone to recognize..anything. Everything I have I got through strife. There was nothing but hard ass work.</p>
            <p>They're taking it there now. "The Nigga got to die" I'm not going to get into an American history lesson, but it's a mindset. It's a colorless mindset. I've been discovering that. I agree with it.</p>
            <p>With that I'll break at 21.07. To be continued.</p>
            <p>Alright back on it again, LIVE</p>
            <p>Before I start I want to go back to the Big G comment a bit. It's the magic of the I AM. It's an affirmation. Truly you can affirm anything as long as it's true to you. However, if I follow the teachings of Neville Goddard and Alan Watts the true magic of the I AM affirmation is I Am God. Taking it back to the source.</p>
            <p>I understand the Bible only as an allegorical source. As a student, even if I consider these people existing, it's the lessons behind their trails and tribulations that resonate for me. I mean its a spiritual feeding whereas to understand the lands and how power shifted I studied that from a scientific perspective.</p>
            <p>There's a level of impermeability, and that stops me from getting to lost in the topic when they start referencing the bible. I mean they start talking about differences and things...To me the epic of gilgamesh is the epic and the bible is the bible...However I will say because of the science behind it all there is a synchrony that I'm not knowledgeable enough to comment on yet.</p>
            <p>Code switching...I think the doc just referred to that difference as code switching...</p>
            <p>right...there's levels to the game, is what I want to say, but code switching is a mode of communication. It's physical and science. I think the doc refers to a level of code switching that affects someone spiritually, and that's personal. Maybe that</p>
            <p>code switching is a topic for it's own blog.</p>
            <p>Lol UH America is tough,but I like to think about how Genghis Khan killed like half the population. Griff and a lot of people in American History have fought for peace and a level of safety, and I do believe they have been winning. Look at the tech. I can move between states in hours/ sometimes even an hour. I don't mean to say they are wrong to assume they should be safe...but scientifically, historically that hasn't been the case.</p>
            <p>I use transportation as an example because I've been learning that's the highest level of freedom one can have. Side note- like fuck the limitations of paying for the ticket.</p>
            <p>What you see is what you get. I like that comment. Lately I've been thinking about art and the propaganda machine. It's like as my favorite people make more money they become slaves to it (it being the money? propaganda, politics? I don't know. Something creeps in and makes things fearful.) Fans believe they have some claim to the product. And they do right...feedback and criticism are imported from the fan base. That's why my blog exists. So I can share my love or hate of a topic. Rap has proven that silencing doesn't work. The worst it ever gets is Genghis Khan. And the push back from the attempt created an era of gangsta rap. It's a game. Always a game. maybe this is another blog.</p>
            <p>Back to the vid.</p>
            <p>The dual consciousness...well Griff is speaking directly against alter ego's but I hope to remember to post a vid I saw about the "Lost art of Alter egos" ...Uhh it's art. I'm always me, but I have this Imp that is still developing. It's not exactly the same thing. I'm hoping the imp is a representation of me online. But Our art is a representation of us. And I hope you've been following my blogs enough to know that I consider everything art. e v e r y t h i n g</p>
            <p>Okay. I have to pause the video and really mention the propaganda machine. I mentioned it already but it's super present in the video and they only allude to it while talking about it constantly. To speak it clearly, as artists there is constantly a force seeking to take possession of the art. It's complicated because some professions work on procedure. Art works off creativity. It's one of the most difficult things to sell because it doesn't help one "live". It's not food or shelter, or medicine. However historically all successful civilizations have had strong creative centers. It's a boon to the living standard. So I guess there is surviving and then there is thriving. Once all the crops are planted, what's next. Once someone manages to make a name or begin to receive pay for what they do for free, people want to plant it and cultivate it. Stick Mozart in the ground and watch it grow into more Mozart      But it's never done for free right, I mean the rap and music. IF you're the bard, say what I want you to say. But before I was The Bard I was always saying what I want to say. It the promise of maybe more money and fame, if you sell out a bit. And you're going to sell. Especially in our economy- its designed for that. But the like Griff already mentioned he was paid 1000 a night so artists todays can get paid 25000 a night. Music and art existed before Griff and they made amazing work. That's all.</p>
            <p>"There's a line you're not suppose to cross"</p>
            <p>I'm not going to bring up that line. Actually I guess I have to, rule number one to how to get rich...find the line and fuck it up.</p>
            <p>Cannon brought up the "they's" .</p>
            <p>I already have deep thoughts about "them" too</p>
            <p>It so uncool to be an individual. Everyone wants a platform and by God you better follow it. There propaganda machine moves like that.</p>
            <p>Cannon I got to split. "Pull your self by your own bootstraps"...well my straps fucking broke and I'm still going. That's how it goes.</p>
            <p>Griff Nick you are two illuminated people. "You can't make a fish fly" Somewhere between those two statements I'm loving on people to work and shitting on those that don't.</p>
            <p>Economy doesn't make the sun come up.</p>
            <p>Maybe the story of Cain and Able is a bit too prevalent in our culture. Maybe there was another path. Maybe></p>
            <p>But it's what we got.</p>
            <p>SO on the topic of people controlling people- My dad tried to control me..in a decent way doctor lawyer engineer, but what made him qualified?</p>
            <p>I'm an immigrant...I watch the news...I watch global news...If the blackman was put "sound alseep" go back to sleep.</p>
            <p>Thing is we let advancement (especially through tech) make us think the world is a safe place. Side note The attack on billionaires is ridiculous- socialism is great but they try to kill the individual.</p>
            <p>The light bearers...There's a book on the keepers of the flame. I'm all about it. I get it from Naruto. I get it from the Olympics.</p>
            <p>Would inheritance make you elite? I say no. I'll save it for a blog though.</p>
            <p>I don't mean to say the elites don't exist.</p>
            <p>Why unite? Independence is key. Individuality is key. To unite there must be a common goal. It's human psyche.</p>
            <p>The most important I work I've heard is compassion. I'm an actor. I spend a lot of time with words. I've sat and thought about passion and compassion. I would say there is a sect that practices a lack of compassion and even a lack of passion. I don't know if I would call them blue blood and I don't know if I could consider illuminate bad. Look once when I was in haiti someone sat me down and I think I was afraid of the dark or something and they shined a light in my eye they said see too much light can be bad. The same was for too much darkness. Well let me nowo give haiti all the credit it could have been my sisters boyfriend but it could have also happen like within a year or two my my moving to the states. The roots...</p>
            <p>Marley still died from cancer.</p>
            <p>Bette wear that sun screen</p>
            <p>The robbing killing raping etcetcetc I guess it's been going on but I always thought it was the mentally deranged rather than a people. It's scary that it may be a people. Again I've been in the streets since I was a boy. It wasn't all easy, but that idea of safety was there but comforted by fight or flight. Safety is something to be protected. I don't think anyone just has it...however I do believe that is why people move to cities. Inner city has always been rough but generally the moves comes with more money which is a better life. Then there's the country which is a different lifestyle but "still safe" I mean it's complicated. I don't mean to excuse bad behavior but I don't support ignorance.</p>
            <p>Actually I would say being in the rough snow would have given white folks a different form of dependence. In the sun you want to be away from people because they only give off heat. In the cold you want to be closer to them. The more the merrier. Body heat is sometimes better than turning on a heater.</p>
            <p>And we're breaking at 38 minutes. This kind of makes me regret not working yesterday, but I just sat and watched movies. I don't feel bad.</p>
            <p>Alright and I'm back on it</p>
            <p>NO new thoughts. Jumping right iin</p>
            <p>"To survive we have to take what's not ours"...I was reading this book that I couldn't get through The Dickins Boy. It was a book but maybe it hit close to home...but in it they mention that the native had a tendency of just taking things and they have to be a bit tough. It was only a mentioning nothing big, but uhh I'm native american...uh the idea of property isn't necessarily ingrained in the culture. We share everything, and are a bit spoiled to expect that treatment. I had to learn how to navigate that amongst christians. I mean I've learned that they would watch you starve. It's just cultural. So where I'm headed in this is that I'm 100 percent sure in modern american culture there is a strong mix of native american culture. A cultural habit from one side is possibility being weaponized by the other side. It's complicated but when times get rough right...the two cultures handled things differently.</p>
            <p>Uh the Dickins Boy was set in Australia. rather than America</p>
            <p>I'm reading this other book called the Bird King. There's a bit of a hunt...like so far the main characters are just running away from a huntress. I try not to judge cultures. I always assume I'm surrounded by a million different thought patters and I'm easily ready to laugh or fight. However where I'm going with this one is that The Huntress is part of the Inquisition. How much of white american culture comes from the Crusaders, I don't know, but there's a power grab constantly happening...Personally Crusaders, Inquisitors, Nazi's I know to stay away from. But in these modern times as we get attacked it's important to recognize that it may be people who elect to follow these doctrins. I have my own as well. I'm not any more or less scared than those who stood against them back then. I admit to a power grab, and there is only one source, but we're not all on the same path. There's a lack of fucks on my end.</p>
            <p>"There to great them with open arms" well there was a few others before them. I always wondered how the bow and arrow took over the world. I'm somewhat sure there was some form of trade happening. Like taking to the seas was mighty dangerous for a while. Like once you land do you stay or do you return, and if you return...I mean...It's a complicated imaginary tale.</p>
            <p>Theft of natural resources might be the Eurocentric world view. We walked around with gold all over us. Understanding it for its beauty and simplicity. We had no idea it was as money. I mean I don't think indians recognize "land". Enemy territory, hunting territory, no go zones etc, but when you've got to move, you've got to move. THe issue I run into is slavery. If you need the gold go and get it. That's never a problem. There seems to be a game of getting other people to do things and indians are sensitive to territory...just not "land". The real theft is of time.</p>
            <p>Lol women</p>
            <p>Aye...</p>
            <p>I don't know what to say.</p>
            <p>Juicy J said it best</p>
            <p>You can't explain hate.</p>
            <p>"Life is living in a fear of extinction" real shit. That's the nail on the head. Don't eat for 24 hours...where you gonna be?</p>
            <p>Clearly they've never met a black widow.</p>
            <p>Fear of God.</p>
            <p>Maybe that's why you should love God.</p>
            <p>SO again I'll say "I am God", and follow it with "You can't explain hate, but you can express love"</p>
            <p>Hate isn't what gave the snake its venom</p>
            <p>Africa was named by the Europeans and Europe was named by the Africans. They made that claim. I don't agree or disagree, but I'll use it to make a point. Earlier on this round when I felt compelled to talk about Indians and Americans...the world is defined through interactions. I don't diss cultures but I def don't believe in the man in the sky...or is it space...I don't fucking know it's not my religion. I know people pull up one way and walk out another.</p>
            <p>From a global position we call it Africa. Fuck everyone else and whatever weird as plans they have, I plan on doing a lot of business in Africa. African art with all their resources must be insane. But I still have to figure out where to go? Madagascar? Ivory Coast? South Africa may be a little too commercial. They hosted the soccer or Olympics a few years ago. Central Africa? It's a big ass place. It's disrespectful to just look at the place and be like Africa, but it's disrespectful to expect someone to rattle off names.</p>
            <p>But isn't that very separatist. I mean Detroit is Detroit and Michigan is Michigan, but are you any less Michigan because you're from Detroit?</p>
            <p>Detroit is in Michigan for ye ol foreign readers</p>
            <p>"we need to find our tribe" that's an easy way of saying there's a place for everyone, and not everyone is your friend.</p>
            <p>Indians when a river dries up, we go somewhere else. That's all.</p>
            <p>I accidentally skipped to a dave chappel mention and have no idea how to find my spot. I've watch this already, so we're moving forward from 47.34.</p>
            <p>Fuck these motherfuckers bro. I love the dress. It's fucking hilarious. I saw this totally awesome dutch movie called Bon Bini Holland. Great film. Medea, Great films. Martin Lawrence films GREAT FILMS. Big Momma I think it's called. Don't be so quick to give up a smile. People work very hard for them.</p>
            <p>To that same point, the outside world is up an artists ass. Don't you think they can tell the difference between a character and a person.</p>
            <p>I mean...I've always hated society acting like gays don't exist. Some of these motherfuckers just stepped in shit. They gave themselves no mental barriers. Nick, you're forgiven. Acting like a problem doesn't exist don't make it go away.</p>
            <p>So I was chillign waiting for the library to open up. My phone broke and I'm suer limited to a few tech options. So library it is. And I realized, the seed and the dirt. That's all.></p>
            <p>There is psych warfare. Like when you said hello to a homie and dude pulled his hand away at the last moment. It's not psych warfare, it's emotional warfare. We do it all the time. I realized last night my favorite nickname for a female is puppet. It's what we do when we buy jewelry and try to make them laugh and ask them out and stuff, it's emotional warfare. Try to make them feel good so they give up a little something, the thing is they give it up if you make them feel bad as well...you have to determine the quality of your gift. You have to make a purchase.</p>
            <p>Aye homie..I'm an artist and since leaving college and moving up a rung I feel like queers are all over me for what I can do on stage. Look I go to the strip club for strippers, and I go the the movies for whatever the movies have to offer. Why do I feel like a "piece of meat on stage" is beyond me. Are you paying attention? About 100 different professions moved to make the moment possible.</p>
            <p>But that was a side note. What I meant to say was...it's not theirs.</p>
            <p>Even in a discussion of this height, you're still giving up too much.</p>
            <p>All the best artists always claim themselves, that includes their upbringing. They know it's the only way.</p>
            <p>Crazy I remember being a kid and thinking what rappers were talking about were lies. Now I'm older and understand there's a persona at play, but there still has to be truth, because that's what people want to listen to.</p>
            <p>I mean...black and death...</p>
            <p>And you probably shouldn't reduce your culture to a color.</p>
            <p>On private worship...that's a big word...but I know I don't work for anyone. The only people I fuck with are they ones willing to step up and be like YOOOOOOO, you know.</p>
            <p>The sun reaches everywhere</p>
            <p>Now we're stopping at 57.21. Whew it's been fun. Would love some comments. I've got a few more of these.</p>
            <p>Back at it again. Before I get to it, I want to mention again that there is a psych warfare. I've had my own experiences, with the "dress" and the like. Maybe forgiving Nick isn't quite in my power, but half of the war is intention. Comedy is real, and it's not defined by Shakespeare (where what makes it a comedy is that everyone didn't die in the end). Comedy is taking to the stage with the purpose of making someone laugh. Thank got for Apollo, sometime we fail.</p>
            <p>now 57.21</p>
            <p>There's levels to this shit. Uhh I'm a pretty good dude. I'm happy too. I would happily slay someone, and still be a good person...</p>
            <p>It's a little childish- what Nick is saying, but the situation in general. So the child of the hunter loves to eat meat, it's soooo delicious. But he learns he has to kill his favorite chick. He angry, sad, swears off meat...but you're the child of a hunter...</p>
            <p>You know Grow Up</p>
            <p>alright a lil side note...I'm fucking terrified of the spinx. The fuck. But moving on.</p>
            <p>The Devil is a lie.</p>
            <p>I'm not going to unpack that</p>
            <p>Right...right...There's a bit of a task here. I know how I'm tasked.</p>
            <p>I will say take some shit seriously and shit will just be serious. That's too easy huh. I didn't even unpack my last statement. I guess between working through this talk things have been getting clearer. First there's talk about the American Empire. Though they talk about Africa etc, they are speaking on experience they have undergone in the American Empire. Umm...Someone was dealt an L. A long time ago. I'll tell you I still don't how Egypt made it to my Taino. But it was there and we dealt out an L. I really don't want to make this a history lesson. I'll mention the groups I don't like. The Crusaders, Nazis, and Inquisitors. I mention them only to say that I've always been aware that they surround me. I study, I put the work in, I keep an ear out and stay away from a lot of people. I don't have much belief in government...apparently they believe in a central figure meanwhile I believe in a bunch of cogs. I do my job. And I take it seriously. I take it very seriously...the slave trade made Africa rich as well.</p>
            <p>There's always a system. It's the group running after bulls and the ladies figuring out what to do with them. It's the first seed planted. There's a natural progression that makes total sense, but it's made of people. Play with words, lie, etc, but the truth is always the truth. You cannot lie on the truth. I learned that people really believe their own bullshit. It's the strangest thing. Like I'll fib to get myself out of a hole, but I always know I fibbed.</p>
            <p>Aye bro it's very different that when I swipe my card knowing there is absolutely nothing on it, so go ahead and cashapp $thefermy to keep things like this coming.</p>
            <p>Uhh did it work?</p>
            <p>On the turban, some things I've come to see as mistakes. Abe Lincoln forcing the states not to seceded- horrible decision. We've lost the american empire from that. It started off as 13. Not letting people be racist or wear the swastika, I need to know who you are. I make it clear who I am. But there is no way around interacting with others. I'm a daoist hermetic I know how to be completely alone, and maybe I'm moving towards that, but my dad is christian hermetic and he is there. I didn't want that. You still need to make money. Money is trade and communication.</p>
            <p>No matter what I do, I know I will not get away from people. I have the dao for that.</p>
            <p>Fuck their cointel pro. It's nothing.</p>
            <p>It's nothing because it's not even supported anymore. It's evolved into threats and other things. They'll get nothing from it, and you get nothing being afraid of it.</p>
            <p>And you want something. You want to die with your fingers clawing at something. That's the industrialist way. That's the people who built America.</p>
            <p>Right right...thank mandel or mendeleve, or whoever it is, white america is all about genetics. They are not wrong. But they give no fucks about the spirit of things. There's a lot of magic there too. The source is whole. You don't go to the source looking for bits and pieces. You go to the source not knowing what the fuck it is, and figure it out along the way. And it can protect itself. IT will protect itself. When the attack gets this ridiculous...I know not to give a shit.</p>
            <p>source, path, etcetc, maybe the entity itself. It's the nature of God. A well documented and very appropriate piece of knowledge for a nuclear world.</p>
            <p>YES "The journey of the self, through the self, back to the self" it's all there. It's all there.</p>
            <p>God</p>
            <p>God</p>
            <p>GOd</p>
            <p>GOD</p>
            <p>God</p>
            <p>And maybe I went through the same thing. It's shitty because Griff, Nick, I run businesses. We pick our base. We learn to keep the checks coming by being a working cog within our base. It's how we hunt. There's a machine out there eating businesses. And Ayn Rand had it when she said let that shit burn.</p>
            <p>Trumps having some conversations that I could say are dangerous for me. Nothings a problem until it becomes a problem. I say cointel doesn't matter because they are hacking and reading notes and listening to telephone lines, meanwhile you're just planning. I had a notebook jacked from a car. Just plans. Nothing happens until the cogs on the machine start moving. You can't just imagine a problem.</p>
            <p>And your machine is dependent on other machines. Like fuck that</p>
            <p>Griff is doing it...you can take a horse to water but you can't force them to drink. The info is out there. The book is there. Nick is there.</p>
            <p>This is keeping it to yourself. It's your platform. Your product.</p>
            <p>...It's that L</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 290px;">Good night</p>

                <p>Starting here and going into the video above...I have to make an announcement. I'm a capitalist. Shocking I know. My views may be a little biased...maybe too biased because I couldn't get get through either vid without getting heated. To preface I'll say capitalism is tough and rough...and socialism is the next step. But we have to do it properly. Maybe it's a little to early but in the next vid is a Einstein quote. I completely agree. If no one made you go to work, house paid off everything set would you still go? The everyman may have to always worry about paying the bills, the answer for him may be to go somewhere else to make sure he gets paid to handle business. A business owner might give a different answer. Believe me, they've put in 1000's of unpaid unslept unhealthy hours to come up with a product (I haven't even mentioned selling).</p>
                <p>On the topic of collective ownership, there's isn't just one form of capitalism...it seems the dominant form of capitalism is when the boss takes everything and leaves nothing behind...uhh...ummm...where do you work?</p>
                <p>Slavery and capitalism are not the same things.</p>
                <p>There are businesses that actually give company shares to their employees.</p>
                <p>...like even seperate from the above comment you can work at a company for 25 years and spend 25 years buying stock from that company to have some ownership yourself. Imagine the look on everyone's faces when you show up to the board meeting in uniform.</p>
                <p>I get heated from a capitalist perspective, but what I will not do is process this from a slave mindset.</p>
                <p>At what point do you have a company? When was Apple Apple?</p>
                <p>Apple is still that company that started off in a garage. Many companies are still little boys and girls saying hello would you like some lemonade. I want to be a little mean and say unless you have a company you can't speak on this. Like this guy in the video. Uhh actually first let me explain business growth. I have a product it takes X y z ingredients. X takes 25 days y twice that and z thrice. With only 19 clients I can manage it on my own. 20 maybe things start to get rough and I need someone else on z. If I pay the person (and honestly as someone building a company it's the payment process that stands out to me) then what right do they have over the final product or any other ingredient. Or connects!</p>
                <p>I'm listening to music</p>
                <p>BACK</p>
                <p>I had a change of location and had some errands to run.</p>
                <p>Back where I left off...</p>
                <p>I was going to comment on the dude in the video- the content creator market is super lax. One person chooses the subject matter, sets up the camera, shoots, edits, and posts. All alone. The Marquis Brownlee(bad spelling maybe) dude probably handles all his own production, but what if this guy in the video decided to shoot 5 videos at one time? He'd need a fair bit of research on 5 different topics. If nothing else he could chose to hire someone to do only the research for him. Under his own argument his hire owns his work? In my mind(cough cough) where shit is normal (cough) the credit page stands from something. And I mean I understand the problem from a different perspective...I hire artists for images. I've paid no more than $200 so far. And I know that they have released all ownership, but what if after flipping those images for $200,000 they want a bigger cut. I mean I'm not a drawing artist. In the points I look towards the contract. Like shoul a developer get a cut of the restaurants Profit? CAN WE JUST ACCEPT TO GET PAID.</p>
                <p>Okay no one other than the CEO knows what te final product is. I hire artists for a series of images...you don't know for what! Fool.</p>
                <p>Okay on the topic of they want collective ownership but don't care about personal property...at what point is the business collective? I've already said that unless you're a CEO you can't comment. There is no personal life for a CEO. EVERYTHING I OWN IS COMPANY. I EAT COMPANY. I FUCK COMPANY. now I as I expand within my company there is an idea of personal ownership which is important for a company like mine. But it's still very different. I've been listening for years and have already designed a few things to tackle certain issues, but by God not socialism.</p>
                <p>Are people retarded? Do people understand convenience?? Has no one noticed a shell gas station across from each other? Then a BP on the next block? We've been moving toward a more convenient society. This is the society of take the stairs rather than the elevator. Why buy a car when for 9 bucks a month you can rent one at 15 an hour? If you ride more than that buy a car. Get you that ownership booboo. If you don't....maybe you work around the block, grocery is two blocks away, and the bus can take you around the rest of the way. Boom. It's for you....now I know I mentioned the bus. A bunch of scary stuff happens on the bus, and it's not cool to pick up chick's after the club on a bus...BUT IT IS! IT FUCKING IS.</p>
                <p>There's been a throughline that been mixed with safety and convenience that is being thrown away saying "you don't own anything".</p>
                <p>No one said you can't own a house or car or any big purchases. Jewelry. Dude brought up a toothbrush as personal property. Go the fuck to bed.</p>
                <p>Oh please let me cry because I have access to millions of songs for 10 bucks a month. Pease wait while I cry...you know how many albums I have purchased like 5. I started making money after the iPhone. I didn't even have a chance to steal that many songs.</p>
                <p>Millions</p>
                <p>For 10 bucks</p>
                <p>Milions</p>
                <p>Million</p>
                <p>M</p>
                <p>It's a different form of consumption. I recommend buying music and TV. And I'll say that I'm a little pissed that so few people do that Amazon is the only place to get cd's. Look big tech we still want to buy music. But nigga's be broke and it's good to get a taste of the music before we throw down that 12. I don't think that makes me a slave. I think kit kes me rich as fuck...maybe just rich...streaming did kill the listening party.</p>
                <p>Like did th consumer economy die or something? Like everything is so cheap we might as well be slaves. Look fool everything is cheaper including education so pay the fuck attention.</p>
                <p>It's a gym membership. This dude sounds like he's trying to hit the gym with no membership.</p>
                <p>Do you acknowledge Spotify as a real company?</p>
                <p>It's even hard like Amazon, Tesla, Alphabet...like they only do music...you fucking retard.</p>
                <p>Okay...okay...I use google books a lot. The guy mentioned Amazon kindness ability to revoke and they license rather than sell. I don't know if there's a subscription modle for Amazon but I pay for books on Google. I expect the world to crash and still own those books. I mean...he hit me there. If not own expect access on their platform. Like I'm not going to Amazon saying I already bought it on Google....there's something realy wrong overall.</p>
                <p>Okay "ours to do with what we want" as an artist that hit me. I think it was lil nas who brought some nike's then tweaked them himself(or put is name on them behind some company)...uhh...that's some shit I would do. Like...it's like the artist issue I mentioned earlier. Okay here's what I have to say...what if I brought a 100 pair of playboy underwear then had to use them to wipe a oil dipstick. I swear to God I would make every designer in the world cry, but once the product leaves the store there's been an exchange and I believe it belongs to me. On the topic of nas' shoes if I already paid for the Nike symbol then I can design whatever behind that...now reselling is a different thing. There's a lot more you can getaway with if you don't plan to resell.</p>
                <p>So my response is thT it's ours to do with as we want as long as we don't resell...(what about donations and gifts...I'll leave each artist to their own lawsuits)</p>
                <p>Dude remember the extended life battery? Yeah I had that shit...think I can use those in 2022? I can't even open the back of my phone.</p>
                <p>It sounds like I'm on his side there, but if I had a battery failure, if I knew enough I could fix it on my own. I don't have apple. Apple has a different angle. And can mention companies have the right to governthemselves as they seem fit. And not even fit...as they seem creative. I mentioned some companies give out stock and actual ownership. Apple has authorized dealers to fix phones. Like they actually put money behind that shit. A fuck the world fuck ton. I have always been with android not exactly because I saw the apple play but because of the freedom with the software. I move around a lot. Like there's a bit of killing of the personal preferences here. So Apple.</p>
                <p>Despite apple being a very successful company. I don't think apple needs the army it has. I was there. Never forget I was there.</p>
                <p>I love k cup coffee. Are you getting mad at Kerrig for not allowing dollar tree coffee cups? Have you ever tried to eat food from one restaurant in a different restaurant? I'm sure you haven't- you look like you have good home training- but let me tell you, THEY WILL TELL YOU NO. Buy the after market product and shut the fuck up.</p>
                <p>I think my overall feeling will be shut the fuck up. I'm also holed up in a new York homeless shelter until the summer so support at cashapp $thefermy. (It's almost dinner time)</p>
                <p>Also I had left the club and everyone wanted food from different places. I was trying to eat cookout in a French bakery. Miller lyfe.</p>
                <p>I'm not touching the housing market.</p>
                <p>I will say that property only goes up. So...fill in the blanks.</p>
                <p>What the fuck is a universal housing guarantee?</p>
                <p>A homeless shelter for everyone? I'd vote yes. I feel like to bring it back to that Einstein quote there's an evolution of capitalism. The last few years has felt like throwing it away. I feel like the world especially the states is rich enough to say you have a place if all else fails. A social safety net. Capitalists throw their everything at their dreams, and frequently they encounter troubles. Shelter food and their manifestations should be covered.</p>
                <p>Oh God...yes the bank owns it until you pay it off. Where was this in 2008?</p>
                <p>Oh gawd</p>
                <p>Some of this stuff is super base. Start thinking about luxury items then come again.</p>
                <p>No one cares about your toothbrush bro.</p>
                <p>Okay so ownership takes work. Ownership says I bought this. It's mine. I've had a lot of shit stolen,but I know somewhere there is ledger with all my shit. That's fucking ownership.</p>
                <p>And the same for rent. People want to rent the car fuck it up and send it back. Somewhere there is a ledger saying it was under your protection.</p>
                <p>We're getting poorer...uhh okay I'll say that's true but we are more fortunate. Some of our poverty comes from how easy it is to get a dollar. But you have to work for the dollar.</p>
                <p>Yup. Increase profit, cut costs. <------ see how good they've been. Except lol some companies are surviving off debt. There's a problem around here.</p>
                <p>I'm here for it. Are you?</p>
                <p>One of the best things you can do is support cashapp $thefermy</p>
                <p>Yup. Mofo's will do anything not to pay. It's a game. Play the game kiddos.</p>
                <p>Real capitalists don't do that. Happy people happy products. Happy people attract happy customers. Happy customers are rich customers. Rich customers = rich business. None of the companies that stiffed me are doing well these days. None</p>
                <p>What te fuck is n "owner of capital"</p>
                <p>The person who owns the merchandise?</p>
                <p>Dude I worked for a temp company when vuse cigarettes came out and i snapped the cigarette to the battery all day for 5 days a week. Do you think I stood there thinking I own this shit. GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.</p>
                <p>And where do Temps fit here?</p>
                <p>All of this is true. That's why I chose to be homeless. I said pay me this much. They laughed me out the door.</p>
                <p>Who buys so much with debt? Where is all this debt. Some of these vids make it sound like people have an unlimited pool of debt when their money runs out. Where?</p>
                <p>We don't want to own fool.</p>
                <p>Capishe</p>
                <p>Banks. He's saying everything belongs to banks. Fuck a mortgage what about a business loan. With a mortgage you know you don't plan to borrow more. With a business loan you're in the bank begging and paying everyday. Doesn't the bank own me then? Even when THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS</p>
                <p>You're thinking too much.</p>
                <p>If someone tells you can't afford $500, run.</p>
                <p>Run and don't look back. That's a theif.</p>
                <p>I have Spotify, tidal and SoundCloud. They don't all have the same material. Whereas ll of the business comparing coming from. These are all very different companies.</p>
                <p>That's why you resist. That's the ;wee point.</p>
                <p>Capitalists will hear.</p>
                <p>And we're done. Thank God. But there's another one. I might not have it in me.</p>
                <p>Another point that I was trying to work in is purchasing- like wait lists and lux goods where you have to have this before you can get that.</p>
                <p>The American is a complex dream.</p>
                <p>And you don't just own everything. Never.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 290px;">I bring waitlists and tge like up because isn't that the kind of favoritism socialists are against? Then some companies say you cannot resell their products. Lux cars I'm looking at you. Don't these infringe on consumer rights...but like RDJ in blackface we want it.</p>

            <p>You're lying to yourself.</p>
            <p>America has advanced a lot and economic and social control have shifted to reflect other communities. That's not to say that whites have become second class citizens but maybe a little too brutishly people are trying to push white power under the rug (because it's not going anywhere) and applaud a few other powers.</p>
            <p>All lives matter. If you mean it then you mean it.</p>
            <p>You low key acknowledge being the majority in your class. And claim you don't need to be validated but then praise to the minorities make you feel a type of way.</p>
            <p>The majority minority argument is not important to me. However this takes me back to "everyone gets a trophy". Losing sucks. You'll be alright.</p>
            <p>Activism and education. I know this well. The smartest person I know is my dad. Does he do anything with his knowledge. Not quite. That's where I come in. Education is a prerequisite for activism. And education demands activism. I listened to a talk with Adam Newmann and he summed it up. "What are we talking for"></p>
            <p>**if you haven't noticed yet I'm jumping around quite a bit. I could have stopped at the first comment, but this a business and I should give the readers something to read.</p>
            <p>What did this lil white boy say?</p>
            <p>Before he quoted Whites have a pretty good situation right now unquote</p>
            <p>I must apologize for my opinion that you are lying to yourself. I do believe in the game and believe there are whites out there that slip a dog a bone. It must be down right ridiculous for you to be called racist, privileged, and differentiated. That being said I stand by my opinion.</p>
            <p>Docking grades? You could hope they dock grades. People get fired for that.</p>
            <p>Aww man. I was hoping I heard the democrats republican quote here. I forget how I planed to tie it in earlier, but it was probably when you mentioned half the class is white and the other half Latino, Asian (it sounded like there may have been more, but I think that's all you said). I'll say it another way. Democrats hate to lose, Republicans know what it's like to lose.</p>
            <p>Alright I've been studying for a few months now and this is maybe not the fiirrrrst time, but the first time I hear socialism v. democracy rather than capitalism. I've been studying socialism v capitalism since I'm a capitalist.</p>
            <p>THROW IN A QUARTER- cashapp $thefermy</p>
            <p>I guess I have more studying to do.</p>
            <p>Maybe they shouldn't work there. Maybe that's not where they should be. Institutions have a right to push their agenda. That's why institutions are formed. Sure schooling is different, but there are tiers for a reason.</p>
            <p>YAYYYYYY</p>
            <p>Sure it sucks getting shitted on for skin color and political views. I applaud you for the switch.</p>
            <p>Good luck and OoohhhOoo shit.</p>

            <p>I still don't know how the climate factors into the issue. Beyond common sense.</p>
            <p>How does the climate effect debt?</p>
            <p>Comment below</p>
            <p>Man made issues with Venezuela being an example (poor investments)</p>
            <p>Okay okay so it looks like a point was made where if the country is dependent on dams for electricity, and a drought occurs that can be catastrophic. That's a big way the climate can affect debt.</p>
            <p>Doomsday bunkers...billionairs and eccentrics get a bad rep...I think.</p>
            <p>Okay I'd say the guys filming or producing and directing are billionairs. And this is from a billionaire pov. I'll note the "eat the rich" culture. I'll save most of my views for a blog. But the idea that a builder will dig up a bunker is ridiculous. Like comment share support to find out why in the future.</p>
            <p>*the vid...I'm a couple 0's shy of a billion. Cashapp $thefermy</p>
            <p>I've done a lot of research on the 2008 crash especially. My mindset is if you send you money out expecting/knowing you'll get more back, then you did nothing wrong.</p>
            <p>Debt traders...don't quit your 9-5</p>
            <p>Again...I'm confident that climate change is really about water. Now I cannot negate the other issues. I can say well the high heat will melt the caps and produce more water, but that's very shortsighted because of long dead virus'. Then the hot regions will only get hotter, droughts will kill crops we've grown dependent on. I get it. It's absolutely terrifying. Wind energy will be hit as well. Nuclear may be the only option at this point. Solar is slow money.</p>
            <p>Sidebar: dude said you got to clean the sidewalk, buy sidewalks are public property. I'm not captain save a hoe, call me captain shoot a cop.</p>
            <p>Reaganomics- I only know it in name...that's next though. Stay tuned. This just became a series.></p>
            <p>Right the American system is roman...and I'll break there for now.</p>
            <p>I'm back!</p>
            <p>Hella accents in the vid</p>
            <p>Thoughts formulated...on the topic of the Roman system failing and it's parallel to current times the host says "except it'll be the whole world". America isn't global. It's not necessarily America's fault. The millenials are gone. They were the only generation raised global. All the others were wolves, and if you read back in my blog millennials were completely oblivious of the generation game. So the whole world may burn, but not like Rome.</p>
            <p>It's like what everyone else keeps saying. Whatever's coming is going to be ridiculous, unexpected, and in no way prepared for.</p>
            <p>The above is just my opinion though.</p>
            <p>Next solid point, Americans build homes everywhere. Even in dangerous places. I don't know if this is a thing in "other or many countries". My reason is that we're super capitalist. Or homes or towns revolve around the biggest business in the area. Desert towns and run down cities come from this behavior. If I haven't done a blog on this yet, I will. It's a mental shift, but it should be completely affordable compared to the past.</p>
            <p>Uninsurable homes...companies looking into where a future flood may happen and decline to insure a home of area of homes. Uhh..this reminds me of the tobacco smoker...uhh we know how that goes.</p>
            <p>So now my ignorance comes in. I mean it was explained. But (maybe) like essentially your mortgage money comes back to you. Maybe insurance plays a bigger role in that than just a flood or fire...l mean clearly once they list your home in a flood area things are more bleak than if it weren't. I guess your insurance options will help drive up the cost of your home, or down. And you're counting on that money for retirement, college, selling profit, etc. Big bleak shit.</p>
            <p>"Nature is going to be the eroding (factor) to our economy". So I hope you've been enjoying me realizing why the last 5 years have been all about climate change.</p>
            <p>So...even in my 30 years on earth it's easy to forget money comes from some place. Generally we have two sources in America government and personal (1buck would do, but we generally mean billionaire).
            The thing is...there are a million solutions...but uhh money has go to the right place and the options to fix presented to us are slow returns. American culture is cash cow culture.
            Again it takes a mental shift, that the richest and freest generation, can totally afford.
            </p>
            <p>So for my altruistic folks "climate change" has nothing with Earth day or the like...the earth will be fine. That's what I've been confused as hell about the last few years. Rather it is only our designs that are at risk. Again our moves and actions are leveraged on home ownership. Homes while usually we study seiges and wars or burglary have another conqueror, God.</p>
            <p>The threat is that He'll knock them down faster than we can build them. Erosion is a thing mates.</p>
            <p>A buck will do, just play your part. -Fermy</p>
            <p>I'm pretty sure Somalia will do just fine against climate change.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 290px">And finally only Jeff Bridges can root this.

                <p>I've gotten fired from practically every job I've worked since 2018. If not actually fired then that fake firing shit. I'm still with Nick though. I've opted to stay committed to my hustle.</p>
                <p>What interests me the most about his subject is the doomsday youtube videos. The dollar is crashing. Inflation. Personally as an investor I'm having a difficult time calibrating.</p>
                <p>Another thing is the subject of the homeless. Back when the States was in a healthier position. (a 16 year old could get a credit card) The idea was if you want work, then you'll get it. However, I like and respect people and their decisions. Therefore, what could make someone not work? No matter what I've been going through I've been going to work, but I do have a better idea why now.</p>
                <p>When I hear unemployment rates, I think about technology. Nick has already said that there are a crazy amount of jobs that you really don't need much education for, but I think robots are already suppose to have claimed those jobs. I picked art for this reason.</p>
                <p>Like really...maybe it's just me, but like who are you when you don't have to go to work everyday? How do you spend the extra time. I'm paused at 2.05 right now. moving on.</p>
                <p>What did he say? I think he just mentioned that it's mainly the african american polulation.</p>
                <p>Asians and Latino's are underrepresented.</p>
                <p>There's a thing my high school boss told me. I used to try to pick their brain because they were the wealthest and richest people in my life. Latino money rotates in their environment about 4 times before it leaves their environment. I can only guess that the same is true for asians. okay...I'm black. I cannot say that I'm african american, but I'm not uhh well I'm carribean latino and alright demographics are tough, because I'm just not part of the in crowd. Also I've never wanted to be. I'm building my own company and have been since I was 12 years old. As much as the money staying in their environment is a good thing There is a mafia like mentality among these people. Yes support family but I know for me when I moved to new york I was really excited to run to people from...well okay I'm haitian and I was really excited to run to dominicans. They live on the other side of my island. Worst experience ever. I have jail history, I've had products stolen, people play mind games and talk around subjects rather than speak directly. Like I don';t have any interest in these thigs. I used to walk into any restuarent to spend my dasher money, but then it started to feel like the joke was on me...As a business amn I really hate the opinion of money. Or maybe I should say currency. People are willing to steal rather than pay, and I'm like that's not what it's for. I really can't say much because I use a screwdriver as a hammer sometime, but one day that little metal piece is going to fall out. I also grew up in a very non raciest environment. Again support family but you can't don't relly chose why you're around.</p>
                <p>The ting about college is that a lot of people don't work in their major. I loved college but it was really weak. Robert Kiyosaki as adament about if you want to be rich don't go to college. Well I'm an intellectual so I don't regret it and I plan to go back, but he's not wrong. College will make you think there is support where there is none. I have a blog some soon about it, so I'll leave it there.</p>
                <p>Women talk too mcuh;)</p>
                <p>Kids are annoying...alright all jokes aside these are the things that get a man up and out the house. Nothign is more embarresing than an empty belly.</p>
                <p>As a foreigner, people don't see it but there are a lot of responsibilities to the family over seas.</p>
                <p>What he is saying about the foreign dropout and the college grad workforce participation stood out to me. I don't know what he said though.</p>
                <p>Men not working makes sense to me. Again there might not be enough robots in the work force to placate a science fiction novel, but 1965 and automation in my mind the numbers add up.</p>
                <p>I think for my own sanity and struggles I have to say that faggotry is the least important factor. I've been running into it, but no one can force a hire or force me to spend money. A toxic environment is a toxic environment, and unsafe work environment is just that. SO as I listen to him speak that something that's been on my mind, but the logic behind it makes no sense. Even with that in the work place, there somethign else like Nick keeps saying. I have my own theories but I wan tot let Nick talk.</p>
                <p>It's just not how money works.</p>
                <p>I think for men leaving the work force we should consider their work history. So would a man look at doing the same thing he's always been doing for another 10 years. I know a lot of men myself included who would rather leave then become stale or downgrade.</p>
                <p>So maybe...okay still on the above post...maybe I was incorrect when I said it's not yet a scifi story. I mean we all have machines in our pockets. Maybe we're a lot farther along than I imagined. if we're starting at 1965 to today...look at what changed. So much. Already we know the idea of working 40 years at a company is dead. So dead that amazon a company that I have no reason to imagine being gone in 200 years, and those employees are socially considered "slaves" either as a joke or somethign serious. In 1965 after high school or college it was assumed you'd be there till retirement. The narritive is a lot more different.</p>
                <p>in 1965 those amazon workers woul dbe normal af</p>
                <p>They should get rolex's</p>
                <p>Unmarried foreigner!! Right here.</p>
                <p>To connect this with other data...do you know the amount of lesbians and transgenders that have been in the news? Crazy</p>
                <p>13.55 okay I had applying for jobs. I hate applications. It's a millineal thing. I don't even fill out form online half the time. I cannot believe the amount of times I have to input the same fucking information. It seems like somethign small, but it really is not.</p>
                <p>Because then you spend 45 minutes filling out informatin and another 45 on some test, and then you don't even get the job. Walmart.</p>
                <p></p>Maybe the workshop is the problem rather than the force. Because women of 55 I mean If you made it to that point, I would imagine you would keep going. The human brain loves regularity.</p>
                <p>That's really important</p>
                <p>Humm people living with family and people making money from government...okayokayokayokay...I mentioned earlier I hate how people treat money. This is about the workforce, not a financial video. Iwatch those a lot. This is about work. Work. I hate that. Work and money are not married. Maybe if I read this over I'll do a blog. It's moreso my political views or personal views. Honestly everyone should have a food stamp card. That's all I'll say for now.</p>
                <p>There are ways to find out what people watch. That data is collected automatically.</p>
                <p>21:47</p>
                <p>If they are handicapped how are they even getting mentioned?</p>
                <p>Sorry it's about why they are not working.</p>
                <p>Well on the topic of jail...I'm going to jail. Just the other day someone ate my food and I smacked them and the police pulled up with the hand cuffs.</p>
                <p>Oh the reason why I'm going to jail is that my appointed lawyer was like you can't do that.</p>
                <p>A lot was jut said. I gotta say the legal system in the US is straight trash. Like as a business man I'm trying to calibrate myself. To design the best products etcetc. It's difficult when I'm surrounded by doomsday data (inflation hyperinflation, etc), but then you know that's economy...people run the economy and it's a business responsibility to make thiings positive. The legal system is a diffferent monster. Kind of like the handicapped folks. You really don't want someone sick even with a cold coming ot work because should the reast of the force get sick that bad for productivity. So That's where I wonder why are they even getting the screen time they got. As for going to jail the best example I can give is I was once stopped by the police and they decided to jump me because the copper felt threatened. I can't contest that. So when someone has jail time what am I suppose to say...you shouldn't have jail time? What judgement can pass? That being said I had a case that was dropped to a misdeameanor and I have been able to get work. However the problem seems to be with coworkers and unsafe working environments. Which is when I say maybe the problem is not the laborforce but the workshop itself.</p>
                <p>Depressoin is real. Again I wonder why this gets all the screen time. If they can't work, they can't work.</p>
                <p>Okay I think we're getting to my theory. I mean machines are taking over. Look where have women made their money? Care (hospitals, childcare, etc) these industries couldn;t be automated from 1965-2010. for men they jobs have been incresingly automated every decade since teh invention of the motor. My problem is in how we percieve the situation. And sadly I see men becoming slaves to the machine- the very thing they created. Sadly it's a social thing. You have to work to eat. that's been a staple throughout all time. Things are really changing. Maybe this is for another blog but apparently people are scared of AI killing the human race...I think it's more likely that the human race will kill the human race.</p>
                <p>It makes zero sense.</p>
                <p>For women now children can learn virtually (I wans't even used to male teachers growing up. As recently as 2015 I had to be like oh yeah sure it's okay that a man is making my sandwich). Machines can do surgery, and even dental work. Maybe maybe maybe</p>
                <p>maybe money not just currency has outlived its use. Do we want to pay machines an hourly wage? What's the deal here? I'm a technocrat. I think about these things.</p>
                <p>No matter what the past was we are here now.</p>
                <p>I think it's a falacy to rely so much on the beneficiary's of the past. Like look where we are. Rather look at the rags to riches stories. I think another problem might be a push to skew the story in a specific direction. If that's what it is...well again...look at the rags to riches.</p>
                <p>THis is a horrible reason for UBI. From the details they presented. From my angel I fuck with it. But there is a solid chunk of people mentioned the handicapped (depression included) to the incarcerated I mean why give them a UBI? They already get support from the state- the handicapped atleast. For it's already illegal to not hire someone because of their cirminal history. I'm sure they can get work.</p>
                <p>Exactly...</p>
                <p>Do you want to buy more of this.</p>
                <p>I work for weed, so I smoke weed. Like anything else. I'm self employed so I wouldn't care smoking weed on UBI, but for those who don't work in teh first place?? Really?</p>
                <p>10-11 million open jobs 7 million eople not looking for work.</p>
                <p>IT's the tech. It's the fucking tech.</p>
                <p>It's absurd today.</p>
                <p>Woowwwww...clearly the japs don't watch their own game shows.</p>
                <p>yes 47:57</p>
                <p>I think what unique of this situation is that the states is know for racism. But leet me clarify. There is a form of racism that the old guard had that still had respect. There is a new racism that lives like an idea of racism. The whole world can crash but that's okay because we're racist. That's part of the problem. We're going to keep doing the same thing while watching everything burn.</p>
                <p>Yes. I have a thing. I don't like Trump, but I had plans to go to his rallies. Maybe I would have realized he is what the states needed. I'm republican but don;t think I wouldn't go to a democrate rally because I want to know what it is your fighting for. I don;t take it so serious. Maybe the leadingrepublican is fighting for X but the democrate is fighting for Y and I feel like Y is what the area really needs. Fuck building a new road and lets give the schools a raise. I really don;t care much for the name. I believe in limited government and that's the republican pillar. SO I'm republican but I wouldn't just side with republican s in spite of everything else..</p>
                <p>People have to branch out. you have to take risks. Listen to different music. Watch new movies. How are we not doig this. We know how algorithms work. They show you you rinterests. So do it the favor and show it your intersts. Like. maybe facebook needs a dislike button.</p>
                <p>It's crazy in all of this positivity, negativity won. It's crazy.</p>
                <p>Everythign is easy. That's why.</p>
                <p>Like I said or theorized. We're farther along than we thing. Algon on the path tpwards syncrosity. I think that's the word.</p>
                <p>Alright that's about it folks. It took a few hours and I got to pee. Folks give your phones a hug, pretty soon it'll be giving you a hug</p>
